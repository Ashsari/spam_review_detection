"we stayed at the schicago hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference. i have to say, normally i am very easy going about amenities, cleanliness, and the like...however our experience at the hilton was so awful i am taking the time to actually write this review. truly, do not stay at this hotel. when we arrived in our room, it was clear that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. i figuered, ""okay, it's just the carpet."" until i saw the bathroom! although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e., a paper band across the toilet, paper caps on the drinking glasses, etc., it was clear that no actual cleaning took place. there was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and, i kid you not, the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. i know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things ""appear"" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. well, the hilton was proof. i called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. frankly, i found the room disgusting. the hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. rarely have i been so eager to leave a place as this. when i got home, i washed all my clothes whether i had worn them or not, such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. please, do yourself a favor and stay at a clean hotel.

"hotel is located 1/2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you're traveling with luggage and/or kids. they seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking/valet fees. rooms feature either double or king sized beds; no queen beds at all. if you want a little extra leg room in your bed, the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff. rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge, too.

"i made my reservation at the hilton chicago believing i was going to be staying in a classy hotel with many amenities. unfortunately, my stay at the hilton chicago went downhill from the moment i checked in. there was only one clerk at the front desk, and several guests already waiting ahead of me. once i finally got checked in and located my room, i discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk. finally i made it into my room. it appeared nice enough until i went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged. the manager moved me into a new room, so i can't complain too much, but still it was a hassle. finally settled, i was able to relax for the rest of my evening and was looking forward to sleeping in the next morning. that is -- until the front desk called me at 5 am with a wake up call i had not requested! needless to say, my overall experience with this hotel left much to be desired and i will choose other accommodations for my next trip to chicago.

"when most people think hilton, they think luxury. i know i did. i only wish i'd been half right. upon arriving, i was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely. not a very auspicious start, but they did find me another room. granted, the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building. but, fine. i was willing to let this slide. i didn't want to be difficult. in the following days of my stay, it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the hilton very undeserving of the term, luxury hotel. noisy neighbors. rude staff. if the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout, i doubt my sheets were changed even once. next time i'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper. the service couldn't possibly be worse.

"my husband and i recently stayed stayed at the hilton chicago and it was a horrible experience. when we arrived, the front desk clerk was on the phone on what sounded like a personal call and didn't even acknowledge us for at least five minutes. when we got to our room i went to lay on the bed and noticed a black hair on the pillow. i'm am very paranoid about hotels being dirty, so i pulled back the sheets and moved all the pillows around and noticed several more hairs. i called for some new sheets which they said they would send right up but it actually took nearly 30 minutes. the second night we were there we decided to try the irish pub in the hotel called kitty o'sheas because my husband loves pub food. we had the shepherd's pie which was awful. it was watery and had no flavor and it was not cheap! our server seemed annoyed when we complained and did not offer it to be taken off the check. while we had a great trip to chicago, the hilton was definitely not a highlight of our trip. overall, we had rude service, a dirty room and bad food. spend your money elsewhere

"my wife and i booked a room at the hilton chicago three weekends ago, as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel. we were expecting some minutia of luxury. however, this was not the case with the hilton chicago. first, we had reserved a room with a king size bed, but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed. now, we did get a reduced price because of this, but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked. second, we had to change our room key twice. the room keys they used supposedly lost their ""charge"". this is what the front desk told us. so, we had to go up to our room, find out the key didn't work, then come back down stairs get a new key, then get back in. this was highly unprofessional, and they really need to look into their key system. lastly, we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room. we knew this was accurate, but i always check just in case. but two weeks later when i checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card. i had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card. suffice it to say we will not be staying there again.

"for a hotel rated with four diamonds by aaa, one would think the hilton chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty. the only royal thing about this hotel however is that it was a royal nightmare. i should have known from the moment i walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth. first off, as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who couldn't be any older than nineteen or twenty, red flags started going up. the clerk was extremely rude and lazy, acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone. if that wasn't bad enough, the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wife's breasts. she wasn't even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat. after diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys. it shouldn't have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break. okay, that was annoying, but we managed easy enough. we finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip. to our surprise, not to mention our disgust and horror, their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out. it took almost a half hour between the couple in the room, the front desk, and my wife and me to get it straightened out. apparently the night clerk didn't bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk. after what could only be described as chaos, we were finally given another room on the next floor up. we were thankful when we got to it and my wife went to use the bathroom while i dropped our luggage by the beds. hearing a clinking sound i bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed. i was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when i heard my wife cry out. there on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and i noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there. there, in the sink and in very plain sight, was a used condom! so far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back. by then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room, free of charge to make up for our troubles. the room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around. despite being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had, we decided to make due. so while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip i pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access. i shouldn't have even bothered as i've used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds i was getting. with a quick call to the desk i was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment. so instead of worrying about it, we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area. yet again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wife's chest or forgot half of our order. after arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything, we found that our found was not only bland, it was cold! we didn't even bother trying anything else, that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel. i don't know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who couldn't clean a room, but i know that that hotel didn't deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative. that place should be shut down because there is no way they know how to run a decent hotel.

"i had high hopes for the hilton chicago, but i am sad to say that i am disapointed. not only is it outrageously expensive (over $200 for two people for one night), but they expect you to pay over $40 to park your car! they do not offer free wi-fi, but instead i had to pay $20 to get on the internet in my room. i had to wait until 3 pm to check in (even though my flight was in the morning) and i had to rent a car at the airport because the hotel did not offer transportation too and from. after all of this stress, the hilton chicago didn't have an in hotel bar either. i doubt i will stay here again!

"we booked a room at the hilton chicago for two nights to stay the weekend, but upon arrival our reservation could not be found. i even provided the hotel with our confirmation number, but it still wasn't available! fortunately, another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us. once we settled into our room for the night (after a long flight), there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom. apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival. needless to say, with both of these poor experiences in just one night, i will be hesitant to ever stay in this hotel again, let alone any other hilton around. please consider someplace else before the hilton chicago!

"i've stayed at other hotels in chicago, but this was the first absolutely horrifying experience. first off the staff was incredibly rude. i could have lived with that being that it was busy, but when the person would not get off their cell phone while a was checking in it had me wanting to pull my hair out. the room was also horrid. it smelled like sex and cigar smoke so bad in there that i was convinced a politician had just checked out after using it for a cheap affair. there was also what looked to be dried snot on the shower curtain. mark my words: never again will i stay at this dump!

"during my stay at the hilton chicago it has been quite unpleasant. how so you might ask? well ill tell you, the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible i mean they weren't even at the desk when i checked in. also, when i ordered my breakfast, lunch, and dinner from room service i received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch. finally, the bill was charging me for stuff i didn't want or ask for. but overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others. i give it a half a star.

"i stayed two nights at the hilton chicago. that was the last time i will be staying there. when i arrived, i could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking. they wanted at least $10. what am i paying for when i stay there for the night? the website also touted the clean linens. the room was clean and i believe the linens were clean. the problem was with all of the down pillows etc. don't they know that people have allergies? i also later found out that this hotel allows pets. i think that this was another part of my symptoms. if you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks i suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. i did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. beware hidden costs. i will try somewhere else in the future. not worth the money or the sneezing all night.

"the hilton chicago, located on prime real estate in downtown chicago, has not aged as gracefully as other hotels around the country opened during the same period of time. the hotel does maintain the appearance of luxury that has made it iconic, but that luxury is not in accord with 21st century standards. lacking any form of fitness center, the hilton is almost alone among the major hotels of chicago in forcing its patrons to go elsewhere for a quick workout. even nominal fees for wireless internet use in hotel rooms is very rare at this point, and the outrageous parking fee of $43 for guests will discourage out of towners from making the hilton their destination. most guest rooms are no different than any other hilton anywhere, meaning that unless you are staying in the admittedly fantastic executive suites, you will be paying a premium for a prosaic hotel experience.

"i stayed at the hilton chicago back in july. for a ""luxury"" hotel this place did not meet my expectations. for starters, we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room wouldn't be ready for at least another hour! i'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee. since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel's restaurants, kitty o'sheas. well, we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks. once we finally got to our room it was ok, although not great for the price. we had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view, and there were not extra towels as i had requested. we had to call room service twice to receive them, then another two times because our air conditioner wasn't working. fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so i could barely use internet on my phone. next time i'm in the chicago area i won't be staying at the hilton. i'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money.

"the hilton chicago boasts to be one of the greats but falls into a cliche of a hotel. there are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from king with two bathrooms, lakeside view or suites. it only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill. you will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return! the staff is nice but when i stay at a hotel i do not go out of my way to seek out the staff. the casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap. next time i stay in chicago i will be looking elsewhere.

"my husband and me reserved a room online for the chicago hilton. we were looking for a quit few days away from home and work. unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for. first of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos. the floors looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while in the check in area. the room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side. the staff was horrible. we had asked for a turn down service it was never received. i would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone. chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the hilton.

"i stayed at the hilton chicago during a recent business trip. i elected to go with their executive suite upgrade. all i can say is, ""what upgrade?"" it's barely anything above what you get normally. and for the price i paid, i was expecting much better acommodations. because i arrived around 10:30 the night i checked in (delayed flight) i did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10. i find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet. beyond that, it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room. first it was a room mix-up, then it was a missing key card. that was extremely frustrating as i was tired and i had a presentation to give the next morning. speaking of the next morning, the complimentary breakfast was a joke. when i just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast, i'll stay at the next super 8 i find. and the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed. i will not be staying at the hilton chicago every again even though i frequent chicago. this tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot.

"i really wish i could say that i liked this hotel, but the whole experience was just plain awful. my first warning sign should have been when i made my reservation. the person i spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing. at first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel, and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel i was actually wanting, he booked me for the wrong dates. he read me the right dates, and it was only when i called back two days later to confirm that i found out he'd given me the wrong dates. hilton did get it fixed, but i already had a bad feeling about my stay. then came actually staying at the hotel. the people at the check-in desk were downright rude. then there was the room. i was supposed to be in a non-smoking room, but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. the hotel staff refused to believe me, but did let me change rooms to one that didn't smell of cigarettes. however, i might as well have stayed in the first room. i was short towels, and it took four calls(over a period of 12 hours) to the front desk to get some. the sheets had not been changed, made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them. yes, i was able to get fresh sheets, but like the towels, it took several hours for them to be delivered. since this is a pet friendly hotel, lucky me i got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs. the walls were so paper thin, all i could hear all night was barking. when i complained about it, the staff refused to believe me, and said that the walls of the room are so thick i shouldn't be able to hear anything from next door. yeah right. i was excited to use the pool, but just like my room, it hadn't been cleaned recently. then, i tried the fitness center. half the equipment was broken. i tried to cut my stay short, but of course this hotel wouldn't work with me at all. they even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness i had to deal with. i will never stay with hilton again, and i will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was.

"my family stayed at this hotel and walking into the lobby i expected a very good experience. once i made my way to the counter and was greeted (not really) i knew this may be a bad experience. the customer service person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes. once i got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out. the high chair that we requested still had spots of food on it. the rest room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper. after we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid. luckily we only had to stay there one day. one day was almost too long.

"i was very disappointed with this hotel. the front desk clerk was rude; she was on a personal call and took 10 mins. to get off the phone. when i arrived in the room the bed wasn't made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty. i called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignment(on the twelveth floor). once downstairs the clerk treated me as though i had done something wrong. when i arrived in the new room i found the bathroom less than clean... there was hair all over the floor, toilet and shower. the shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror. my allergies started to bother me, immediately upon entering the room, so i checked the filter in the air conditioner. which looked like it had never been cleaned.the comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum. while waiting on acceptable room i went to dinner. which proved to be as bad as the rooms. the lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy. the steak was rare and i asked for medium. not to mention, it tasted like rotten meat.the veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry. to top the whole experience off... when i went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay.

"when i went to the james hotel in chicago i truly expected a luxury experience exactly like what they were advertising. gorgeous chairs, staff at the desk focusing on their job, and a clean, well decorated hotel room. much to my, and my wallet's dismay i found quite the opposite. i arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed, and found the clerk reading a magazine. it must have been a fascinating article, as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if i had a reservation, or would be making one. i said i had one, and gave him the voucher i'd printed out. he checked it, and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out, he went on to say that i would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if i wished to stay the night. i grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and i desperately needed to get some sleep. the clerk offered to walk me to my room, saying i looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after i got some sleep. i accepted, and followed him to my new room. he carried the briefcase i had with me, but it was not apparent why at the time as i had both hands free. he ushered me into my room, setting the briefcase down inside, and said if i needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything. i thanked him and closed the door. it was then that i looked around and fully saw where i was staying. what was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6"" apart, covered in ruffled blankets and sheets. the cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently. a quick look around the other areas and i found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap, not even the complementary ones were left behind. i got ready for bed, and looked around for the tv remote, which it turned out, had no batteries in it. instead, i just turned out the lights and rolled over, sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option. in the morning i walked down to the lobby and asked to check out. i'd had enough of the hotel after one night. the clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill. $240 for my room, and an extra $80 with a note about a baggage service. i asked her about it, and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service. i asked if it was considered reasonable to charge $80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up, and riding the elevator, and she said it was unusual, but not unheard of. she offered to change it to a ""mere"" $20 and handed me a slip with a phone number, name, and reason for the disagreement, saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and i after i signed it. i did so, and left, my wallet $260 lighter, and my head throbbing with a headache from lack of sleep.

"i recently stayed in the james hotel in chicago and trust me i will never do it again. when you pay a premium price you'd expect first rate service. our whole experience was a disaster though short lived b/c we could stay their another second. when we arrived at the hotel we had to wait while the receptionist finished playing with her phone for service and then our room was not ready. so we had to wait in the lobby with our baggage. when we finally got to the room i wouldn't exactly call it clean but it wasn't to bad. the pictures on the website are nice enough but the furniture is falling apart and probably from walmart. there was plenty of space for an average person of 5' but i'm 6'4"" and the beds where smaller than what they said, not to mention uncomfortable. we ordered room service and not only did they bring us the wrong order but it took 2 hours. there walls were also paper thin so we got little sleep. the heater helped block out some noise until it stopped working in the middle of the night. so the next morning, sore from the uncomfortable bed, hungry tired and cold we checked out before we even had our coffee. stay away!

"i was disappointed in my stay at the james. i am on a strict gluten free diet and was told the hotel restaurant could accomodate my needs. each time i sat down for a meal, i would explain my dietary needs to the waiter. most times, i ended up having to send the plate back because some gluten item was included. my wife has sleep apnea and when we made our reservations, i made sure to ask if there was a room available with an outlet near the bed so that she could plug in her cpap machine. i was assured that this was no problem. however, when we arrived at the hotel, we had to request a room change because there was no outlet near the bed. we had to wait in the lobby for sometime because the room we were moved to was not yet finished benig cleaned. overall, it was not an entirely horrific stay, but i expected more out of a hotel of this supposed caliber. next time i visit chicago, i will be staying at another hotel.

"i was initially excited when i found out that my employer was sending me to chicago on business, but i could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of the james chicago. when i arrived, my reservation could not be found in their system, although i had made it myself. after some words with the manager on duty, mr. chad montgomery, i was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate. anyone can make a mistake, so i wasn't too angry at that point. my room was bland and colorless, in spite of the james' boasts of their attention to design and detail. the room was mostly clean, but after seeing the stains on the bedding, i am not convinced that they were washed after the room's last occupant. i attended a stressful business meeting in the dining room that night, complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy, disgruntled waitstaff. afterward i decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order. i was assured that i would enjoy ""asha's purifying shower ritual"", which would primarily take place in my own room. the shower was okay, but i think i must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided, because i broke out in hives all over my body. next came the ""in-room"" portion. while i was in the shower, five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room. i guess they were supposed to make it smell good, but i began choking on the odor the minute i walked in the room. my masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion, but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking. i am sure certain areas are not on the massage menu. in closing, if you have ever considered staying at the james chicago, i beg of you to reconsider. with only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel, and a suitcase full of negative (including a pending court case against the masseuse), i can almost guarantee you would regret staying there. i know i do.

"james chicago would be one of the worst hotels i have ever been to in my life! even though i noticed that the design of the place was extremely artistic, its service quality and hotel conditions were horrible. they gave me a room in which the blankets were dirty and looked as if it been used just moments ago! i figured it was because the hotel was busy but i started to notice that the furniture came with a cost in service. the television was not working at all. i was extremely disapointed, especially when coming from a rigorous day of work and just wanting to relax. sadly, i settled in doing my work instead of frittering my time doing noting when i got the next disapointment. the wifi was a bust. absolutely nothing to do but to stare at the furniture or just stare at the wall. i am never going to james hotel ever again!

"a recent stay at the james hotel-chicago, revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only. although the rooms and public areas look nice, the hotel still needs serious work. our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke. we asked for a new room which was clean and odor free. we had to involve the manager before our request was granted. the new room was better at first glance, but was severely lacking. we could not get the temperature properly regulated. the room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay. in a hotel commanding the rates of the james, we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted, not something which is a constant battle. our mattress was horribly uncomfortable. when the rooms were updated, the james skipped new mattresses. ours was worn to the point of having indentations you can't get out of--when you lie down, you sort of sink into a hole. this matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a 'luxury' hotel. last, but not least, we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay. in spite of the calming decor, the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night's sleep. all in all, we were unhappy with our accommodations at the james chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location. you will be happier almost anywhere else.

"i was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the james. i had heard from others that it was ""agreeable"" and ""workable"" and ""all right,"" or even ""a nice place."" i figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my long-distance girlfriend. according to the website, i was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and ""warm tones."" well, when i arrived, i felt like i was in an ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day. everything in the front was just a bit too askew. the staff were busy, distracted, inattentive, and in every way keen to show me i was a bother to them. i handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort. i also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price. it looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before i got there. the bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly, inexplicably, of men's cologne. nobody cared when i complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just ""stuck in my nose"" and that it would go away. well, it didn't, and i had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived. this ruined my entire first evening in chicago. for my price i could have stayed a week at an economy hotel, gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs, and still saved money. and i would not have been treated like such a pest. needless to say, i will be looking elsewhere when i go back to chicago. i may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels, but i know when i am wasting my money.

"when you stay at a hotel like the james, just from their price point, you expect a certain level of quality. if i pay well over 500 dollars for a room, i do not think it unreasonable to expect not only a quality room, but also a certain level of standard of service. perhaps this hotel should rename itself the lebron james, because it has about as much class as he does, and is about twice as pretentious. a handful of baby powder thrown into my face would have been a refreshing break from the level of service i received at the lebron james. my night of hell began with the clerk, bellboy, or whatever he was, at the front desk, who faked what i assume was intended to be a british accent, but ended up as an unholy melding of australian and new englander. a british accent does not make you fancy, or skilled. once i made my way past mr. belvedere and to my room, i was disappointed, not only by its size, which was unusually small, but also a faint scent of cigarettes. not a strong one, but i could definitely smell smoke. not acceptable. then, while i was sleeping, a deep throbbing sound began to emanate from the walls. it sounded technical, mechanical, like an air conditiner malfunctioning. despite many reassurances from the front desk, the throbbing continued on throughout the night. i demanded the man at the front desk come up and rectify the situation immediately, but from what i could tell, he never came.

"recently stayed at the james chicago and will not be returning anytime soon. the staff is unfriendly to say the least and the prices are outrageous. also not a fan of the fact they allow pets as guests. there wasn't enough space in the gym and the lack of variety in equipment limits your options severely. ultimately i was very unimpressed with the services as a whole and would recommend you avoid this establishment.

"if you are looking for a true luxury experience, hotel monaco chicago is not the place to go. i stayed here while visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a luxury experience. i did not get it. check in was not a pleasant experience. the wait was long and the front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. the room was ok, no roaches or anything, but it was small and cramped. and the mirrored headboard on my bed was more tacky motel than fancy hotel. the house cleaning service was really pushy and tried to clean my room at 8:30a in the morning. when i asked them to come back later, they gave me a whole 15 minutes before they came back. and getting extra towels was like pulling teeth. i don't know if they thought i was going to steal them or what. the room service food that i ordered was fine, but it took forever to be delivered and was half-cold by the time i received it. when i called the front desk to complain, they apologized, but did not offer to compensate me or send me new food. they have a restaurant at the hotel, but i did not bother to try it. the prices were ridiculous, the menu was limited, and my room service experience assured me it was not worth the hassel. i was really disenchanted with this experience. at $400 plus dollars a night, i received mediocre accomedations and poor service. spend your hard-earned money somewhere else.

"while visiting the chicago area, we chose the hotel monaco chicago for our stay. as one of the premier luxury hotels in chicago, we held high expectations but were quickly disappointed in what we recieved. the problems began as soon as we arrived. the attendant was not friendly nor did she have the smile that is suppose to be the symbol of kimpton. and, when we went to our room only to discover that we had not been given what we had paid for, the situation only got worse. rather than apologize for the error (my credit card receipt was on hand) we were blamed for the indescrpencies in rooms and told that not only was the room we had reserved and paid for more than two months unavailable, we would not recieve a refund of the price difference of the two rooms. i could not believe that a top 40 u.s. hotel that is suppose to be committed to excellence could make such a blunder! with no choice but to retreat back to our room, we were pleasantly pleased with all of the amenities that we did recieve during our stay. a beautiful hotel in the chicago loop, but don't go expecting to be treated with respect or professionalism.

"i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in chicago for 3 nights. i must say, i was not impressed. this is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill. to start with, the hotel lobby was totally gaudy. it had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and i guess was supposed to give an air of style. the room was ok i suppose, but certainly not worth the premium price i paid for it. the hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing french cuisine, but the food, while arranged nicely, tasted unremarkable and again, was overpriced. my final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible. it is simply not worth it.

"the hotel sofitel chicago water tower bills itself as a 4-star luxury hotel, but the luxury is evidently in the eye of the beholder. filled with trite modern art and modular, cheap-looking furniture that looks straight out of the latest ikea catalogue, this 32-floor hunk of glass has to be one of the ugliest hotels i have ever seen. ""urban chic"" design does not equal comfort; the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use. room service is expensive, slow, and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor. the hotel features two bars: the cafe des architectes bar, and the simply named le bar. cutesy french names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make! excellent service, fair prices, friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great, none of which you will find at either of these bars. cafe des architectes is also a restaurant, offering ""seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with french roots,"" which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality. even the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation, coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak. pass this one by, if you're looking for a comfortable, enjoyable stay in downtown chicago. the water tower is dry.

"the sofitel chicago water tower, while seemingly a good idea in theory, has many drawbacks. at first glance, it appears quite luxurious and grand, but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked. the hotel is quite tall, coming in at 32 stories, and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying. the staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest, so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed. the hotel tries to adopt a french flavor, but its efforts fall short. the only real french influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars. the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city, but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment. the same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general. the city's traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one's stay here. overall, i would not recommend this hotel. make a different choice.

"while traveling in chicago i stayed at the sofitel on chestnut street. though the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest; service was severely lacking. i arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn. i reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area. i complained that i had not been informed of the construction and requested another room. my complaint was totally disregarded. i was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available. when i explained that the noise was bothersome i was treated rudely. the woman at the front desk actually ask me if i thought she could make the workers stop. i understand that the staff has no control over the noise. they did however know about the construction. information i did not have at the time i booked. information that would have swayed my decision. then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention. i will not be staying there again.

"the sofitel chicago water tower in the downtown area is advertised as a four-star luxury hotel. however, modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks. room service is available 24 hours a day, but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service. two bars are located on the premises, which is appealing at first. once inside, patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy, of any kind. the guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean, but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine. obtaining additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult. if you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hassle-free experience, with reliable customer service, booking a room here is probably not a viable option.

"i wish to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at the sofitel chicago water tower. my husband and i had planned a trip to chicago for our tenth wedding anniversary. we had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from california so they could have time with their grandchildren. my husband and i had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to iraq the week after we got married. everyone was so excited! mark and i had reservations for one of the junior suites. we hadn't gone to chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered. unfortunately, when we got to our room, the view was disappointing. we had requested a non-smoking room and were assigned to one, but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there. i am asthmatic and became very ill. we asked to be moved to another room, but were told there were no other rooms (even downgrades) available. nothing was done to try to make up for this. because of my health, my husband and i checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend. this is not how i had imagined spending such a special time. now, when i think of my 10th anniversary, i will always have this memory to tarnish it.

"the sofitel chicago water tower was horrible. the first tip off that this would be a bad experience is when we had called ahead to make sure it was ok to check in after hours and that a concierge would be available when we arrived only to find out that they didn't even have a record of our reservation. after much inappropriate arguing, they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine. when we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or tv. it took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably. the next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in. a quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount. we finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel, the fancypants hotel and suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club. overall, the service at the sofitel was rude, rooms were unsatisfactory, restaurant sub-par, not well kept up or clean. in the future i would never stay there again and wold definitely pick a more reputable hotel with a proven track record, like the fancypants hotel and suits, my personal favorite.

"sofitel not-so-luxury hotels i recently checked out from a short stay at the chicago water tower. i originally planned to stay for a week but as my business was concluded after only 3 days i decided i had had my share of the water tower. simply put it offered no reasons to stay. the hotel is quite lovely and elegantly dressed to impress, but little more is put forth to sway the more acquainted crowed. the first night was a spectacle meal and there was quite a crowd, i think for the weekend. the next night the food was only mediocre and the third when i orderd room service i had to call twice. even if you don't care about the food i think you would be wise to think twice about your stay if you have the choice. they put on quite a show, but that is all and when the show ended i was still hungry for more and there was no more to be found.

"upon first inspection, sofitel chicago water tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown chicago, but appearances can certainly be deceiving. best summed up, sofitel is nothing more than a fancy holiday inn. it certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain, even if it is an international one. the customer service is poor unless you look like you have $50 to tip someone. the furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from ikea. the rooms are dirty when you first walk in, the air feels stale, and the views are certainly all they're cracked up to be. none of this is worth a ""luxury"" price or even worthy of a ""luxury"" name. i will certainly not be staying here again.

"after booking a room over two months in advance at the hotel sofitel chicago watertower and confirming my reservation twice, i arrived to find that the front desk staff had 'no record' of my reservation and that the only rooms available were much more expensive than the room that i had reserved. when i asked to speak to a manager, it took almost half an hour for him to turn up. he did finally give me a room at the rate that i had been promised, but did not offer any compensatory discount or bonuses for my inconvenience. the room itself smelled of dog but was otherwise okay. not worth the rate though. the website really makes this hotel seem upscale, clean, and well decorated, but the rooms are not in the style that you would expect from the lobby. the staff's response to my request to move to another room because of the obvious dog smell (which could only mean it hadn't been cleaned properly) was met with contempt. they did move me, but i did not get an apology. will not stay again.

"affinia chicago is one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at. not in my life have i been treated so poorly as a guest. the front desk was very unaccommodating when i asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation. there was no bellhop available for some strange reason so i had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself. if it wasn't already a bad stay, i ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered. if they didn't have air conditioning in the room, i would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable. if you are traveling to chicago for any kind of business, i hope you decide not to choose this hotel. i was quite surprised, i like chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience.

"i recently stayed at the affina chicago hotel and was really dissappointed. when i arrived, the desk clerk was really slow checking me in. i feel like turtles could have checked me in faster. i was finally checked in and my room was on the 8th floor. the elevator ride seemed to take forever. i arrived and the room and at first glance it looked great, but after looking everything over there were finger smudges on the glass table. i figured maybe room cleanin must have accidentally touched it. i went to the c-house for supper that evening and i had to wait for what seemed like forever. the meal was good, but my waitress was very uptight. on my way back to my room, i asked the front desk to set up a wake up call for 6 am the next morning and they were very grateful to set that up. it would have been nice to actually get it though. the next morning i surprisingly work up at 7:18 am and realized that i had not received a wake up call. i was very upset and let them know. overall this experience was not worth the 4 stars that this hotel has been given. for the price, quality and ratings the affina chicago hotel has been given, i would expect better service.

"i just returned from a long weekend in chicago with my wife. we stayed at the affinia hotel and i can't even begin to describe what an awful experience it was. when we arrived at 4pm on thursday (check-in is 3pm), our room was not ready. we had to wait til almost 5pm before we could even get into the room. once inside the room smelled like an ash tray. obviously someone had deactivated the smoke detectors somehow and had been smoking in the room. we decided to just go out for an early dinner. after arriving back to our room around 9pm, our key didn't work. we had to go all the way back down to the lobby to get a new one. the next morning the maids started knocking on our door at 7:30 in the morning! why would you try to clean the room that early??!! the 'do not disturb' sign was on our door for the rest of the stay. after that early wakeup, we went downstairs to request a different room due to the terrible smell in the one we were assigned. the front desk employee gave me a very condescending look and sighed when i asked. eventually we did get a new room but i didn't enjoy the demeanor i encountered to do so. our new room was fairly nice, and the rest of the stay was relatively uneventful, but i have a bad taste in my mouth and likely won't stay there again.

"my wife and i stayed at the affinia chicago last week (in a studio suite, which was not worth the extra payment). it was an absolute nightmare! to begin with, the room is listed as 'oversized', when it's nothing of the sort. we've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller. i believe the only extra space was in the closet, which isn't very useful unless you plan on living there! we had our two sons with us, so we had to make extra sleeping space. our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time, complaining of bugs moving around. he must have been umcomfortable also, as i sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock. the room service is horrible, they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm, and she had to wait up for that. my family would never go back to this hotel, and i highly recommend you also stay well away.

"after reading good reviews about the affinia hotel in chicago, my husband and i decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our 30th anniversary. unfortunately, the hotel missed the mark for us. i did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a 4-star hotel. because my husband and i have had a bad experience with bedbugs, as a rule, we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel. when i brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, they practically accused us of planting the bugs there. i was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled. needless to say, we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary. i have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation. i have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that i will be refuting the charge for the one night the affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline.

"the affinia in chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences. if you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for affinia, do not expect any measure of customer service and don't expect great accommodations, even at their high prices. when we arrived our reservation was lost, then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available. the furnishings in the room were cheaply made, the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel's l shaped corridor. i called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time. two hours later someone came. the dining hall and reception areas were really nice, but again, unless you're a large group don't expect to enjoy them during your stay at affinia. even if you could, the prices wouldn't be worth it.

"our trip to chicago was a complete delight despite our stay at the affinia hotel. because their rates were actually higher than we were used to in new york city, we naturally assumed we would get a nicer establishment. we could not have been more wrong. this place focuses on gimmicks to set themselves apart from their competition. uunfortunately, it does set them apart but in a strictly negative way. both the ""dream pillow menu"" and the ""experience kit"" were a complete flop. with the ""dream pillow menu"", the hotel offered patrons what seemed to be great pillow choices from down-stuffed to hypoallergenic selections. we happily chose the fluffy down pillows but when we got to our room and laid down on them a giant poof of dust came out. at first, i thought it was my imagination so i stood up and hit the pillows on the edge of the bed. more dust came out them! particles were flying around the room, i'm now sneezing and there was this disgusting grit all over my sunglasses that were sitting on the night stand. i called the desk and they sent up replacements for all the pillows. these pillows were some kind of ""music pillow"" that pluged into an mp3 player. i was sleeping on uncomfortable cords all night. in general, the staff was pleasant and tried to be accommodating, but there was just no apology good enough for filthy pillows. another failed gimmick they offered was the ""experience kits"". we were given (ours to keep) a collection of some maps (which were actually very nice), a walking tour guide that was all marked up, and a handy deck of cards opened and missing two cards. if this place lacked attention to detail, that is one thing, but it lacked any attention at all. if the pillows weren't already enough, at this point i was certain that i would never stay at this establishment again. run, don't walk away from this place.

"i truly am not the sort of person to write a negative review about an establishment, but my time spent at the affinia hotel in chicago forced me to do so. it was to be our first trip to chicago since i was a boy so my wife and i were very excited to arrive and begin our short weekend getaway as soon as we checked into the hotel. first i must say that the counter help was far less than helpful. the apparently confused person who was to sign us in was extremely out matched when it came to the workings of the hotel computer and was total inept at customer service. he said we had not reserved a room, which i had weeks earlier, and proceed to explain to us that his hotel does not make mistakes of this kind and that we must be mistaken as to the reservation or the hotel or both. finally the manager arrived after i insisted on his presents. he did straiten out the confusion, but the room we were lead to was much smaller than we were lead to believe and had not even been cleaned from the last occupants. i called down to the front and demanded that the manager walk himself to our room and see the condition of the place. we were shown to another room, this time to our liking. from that point on nothing and no one that we saw or had contact with worked or acted as one would expect from a hotel with the reputation that the affinia had. to list just a few; the television was a 13 inch black and white which could get only 4 channels, the food that room service brought up was cold, lifeless and bland, the cleaning person knocked at our door at 5 in the morning every morning even with the 'do not disturb' sign on the door, and there was this ever so slight smell of mold and vomit which passed through the hallway every time my wife and i lift the room. to be blunt, i truly hope that the ceo of the company reads this note and fires the entire staff, guts the building thoroughly, and is publicly flogged in a downtown park. we will never step through the doors of the affinia again.

"the ambassador east is a particularly crappy property, given the numerous quality hotels in and around the gold coast. unfortunately, i saw an amazing rate and decided to book -- this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for. while the lobby was gorgeous (and appears to match the photos on the website) the room i was assigned was run down, and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website. it looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls, but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty. the room also smelled of must or mildew. while the room did have air-conditioning as advertised, it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg. i was only here for a single night, but had i been here for anywhere longer i would have requested a refund. please, if you're staying in this part of town, do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here. the hampton inn and hilton garden inn are both nearby, clean, and often have special-offers -- these aren't the only properties in the area, but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay.

"this hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat. the first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket. this place looks alright in the lobby, but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in chicago, this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night. clearly the ambassador east hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession. not to mention that it is at least 30-40 minutes from the airport in traffic. chicago traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached, particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call.

"the ambassador hotel is located in downtown chicago right off lakeshore drive in the heart of the hotel industry downtown. i would recommend you look to one of those other hotels if you are wanting a place to stay downtown. the rates at this hotel indicate that it would be a top of the line place to stay, when in fact, we had a pretty unpleasant experience. it started with someone who was obviously a new employee checking us in. i have no problem with this, except the fact that this person was the only one on duty and had difficulties checking us in and had no one to assist him. after checking in, we went up to our room and were a bit disappointed. the pictures do not accurately depict the size of these rooms, they are very tiny and offer very little room to store luggage where it is out of the way. the beds were not very comfortable and when we called room service for extra pillows, they took over an hour to arrive. i will not be staying at this hotel anytime in the future.

"my experience at the ambassador east hotel was truly terrible. i went to chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding. this hotel was recommended by the wedding party. it was a terrible choice. despite the special discount we got because of the wedding, the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels. the staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. my kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. the place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. my son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart. overall, i would say i was very displeased with the staff, the hotel's attitude towards children, and the expense of the hotel. on the plus side, our window had an excellent view of the city. still, i would not return here again.

"what was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in chicago turned into a complete disaster. the first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in...they knew we had 6! we ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel. when we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other. after some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor, unfortunately one of the rooms hadn't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around. the staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating. on our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5:30am. despite my calls to the front desk, the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes. we also didn't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly. one morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door. i understand they allow pets, but really...people need to clean up after their animals...or have some dog free floors. while hard rock hotel in chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms, their service was terrible, the staff was rude, and i still can't get over that dog poo in the hallway. i definitely won't be staying here again.

"i stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago recently for a convention i was attending. this was my first trip to chicago and i had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so i had high expectations. check-in took a bit longer than i would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations. once i did get into my room, there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room. i went down to the front desk and requested a room change. given their computer problems, that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and didn't have the ""positive attitude in spite of any difficulty"" i'd expect from such a high profile establishment. the new room was not a suite as i had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling. when i hooked up my laptop, i was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service. i had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies, but as part of their computer problems, the wi-fi service was down. fortunately, there was a starbucks up the street with available wi-fi. granted, i couldn't lounge at the starbucks in my jammies like i could in my hotel room, but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices. i was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management. however, the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management. a quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while i was down the street at starbucks. they did as promised and when i arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer's dna and the dust bunny population had been eradicated. once i had a chance to relax in the room, there were a few minor details that stood out. the carpet was starting to get worn in places, the edges on some of the furniture was dinged, and my personal pet peeve... the inside of the drawers were rough, unfinished wood which i dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes. i would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel. but, all things considered, my stay was tolerable. water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep. the wi-fi was still down in the morning so i checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wi-fi at starbucks.

"terrible time at the talbott. when i planned my vacation to chicago i called ahead and made reservations to stay here. when i went to check in i was told i didn't have a reservation, knowing my credit card was charged i argued with the guy who was working. finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else. thankfully they knew how to use the computer. i go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet. i could not believe it when i complained, i was told to spray some air freshener. i had to go visit family. when i got back my room key did not work. once again there i was complaining to the helpless employee. he told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet. i could not believe the mentality of this guy. i had one more night reserved, i could not take it anymore and i went and spent the rest of my vacation at my aunts house. i would not recommend the talbott to anyone.

"i was going on a 3 day personal trip to chicago, and i decided to indulge myself a bit this time around. i chose to stay at the talbot, an upscale hotel in the heart of downtown chicago. to start off, i was not pleased. for the hundreds i pay a day, i expected an impeccable hotel. first, the check-in process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation i had placed nearly a month in advance. some customer service they claim. next, when i went to my room, i found that room service had not cleaned it at all. i was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such. in summary: yes, it was a fancy hotel, yes it had nice accommodations, but the service i experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price.

"after a recent stay at the talbott hotel in chicago, i left the city with an empty pocket book. i had booked a package deal online and although the service was absolutely terrific, i didn't realize some of the amenities i was paying for included personalized key cards and room service menus. i could have done with out my room key having my name printed across it as well as the menu. when did my name printed on things become an extra amenity that cost so much money? i basically felt overcharged for the so called 'extras' included in the package i purchased. one other thing, the traffic was pretty horrible and checking in seems like it could have somehow been made simpler.

"my husband and i were planning our 1st year wedding anniversary and we wanted to go back and spend it in chicago where we had first met. after spending several minutes frustratingly navigating the talbott hotel's website, i finally was able to complete a reservation for a long weekend. after a long flight into chicago, we were so ready to check in, shower, and lay down in our hotel room. however, once we arrived the unfriendly clerk behind the counter notified us that we did not have a reservation. i provided her with the confirmation email and she again said there must be a mistake because the room we reserved was already occupied. she begrudgingly found us a new room after what seemed like an hour of waiting. we then carried our own bags up to our room only to immediately be hit with a rancid smell of cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door. i'm severely allergic to smoke and we ended up getting a refund and locating a much more accommodating and friendly hotel.

"i selected the talbott for my recent family vacation to chicago. we chose the hotel for it's close proximity to navy pier and otherwise central location. in retrospect, the phrase ""location, location, location"" apparently does not apply to hotels. it's a good thing the location was so great, because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad. upon our arrival, our room was not ready. the clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation, and told us simply that ""we would have to wait"" without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready. when we finally arrived in the room, the sheets were not clean. a call to housekeeping proved difficult, as i do not speak spanish. the second day of our trip, housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our ""please service"" sign hung on the door. we stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on michigan ave. when the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order, it was cold and not very good. despite these poor impressions, the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout. my call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in mumbai. they will not receive my business again.

"the talbott hotel claims to be chicago's premiere small luxury hotel. after staying there and experiencing the service, environment, and the hotel in general, i can say with confidence that this just isn't true. i arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and i was immediately disappointed. no one came to my car to collect my bags and i was forced to lug them inside myself. the doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me, leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags. once inside, the atmosphere was not what i expected. the lighting was poor, leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building. the carpet looked dirty, as if it hadn't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time, and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage. when i arrived at the front desk, i was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me. after checking in i went up to my room and was once again disappointed. the bed was very uncomfortable and i ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water. that night i ordered room service. the food took 45 minutes to get to my room, and when it finally arrived it was cold. the fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them. i would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends, and probably not to my enemies either. stay away!

"the name conrad (the most luxurious of all hilton hotels) should illicit nothing but images of pure elegance and luxury; however, the conrad in chicago, il did obviously not receive the memo. upon entering the hotel, we were not greeted by any of the hotel staff. additionally, we were not offered any help. the desk receptionist was beyond rude. her snide remarks towards my wife and me set the tone for a the rest of our stay. after getting our card, we were finally offered help with our luggage. the young man who helped us could barely handle our luggage. strangely, he somehow found more strength when it was time to collect his tip. he received the tip he deserved, which he scoffed about and groaned under his breath as he walked away. upon first looking at the room it was beautiful. however, closer inspection revealed that the room had not been cleaned since the last visitor had left. there was hair in the sink and around the toilet. there was even a used bar of soap in the bathtub. this fact was not met with any apology by hotel staff. instead, i was told that was preposterous and that the room had indeed been cleaned to the highest of standards. two-hours later, someone came into the room to ""investigate"". when they saw the mess that had been left, they offered a menial apology. still another two hours later, housekeeping arrived. the level of incompetence even extended to the valets in the parking garage. in the most incredible display of stupidity of our visit, the valet actually brought the wrong car to me. i was half tempted to take the car that was brought to me (it was certainly an incredible make and model), but my better judgment prevailed. i informed the valet of his mistake, to which he replied, ""sorry dude, i read your ticket wrong."" i know that he did not smoke in my car, but he smelled so strongly of smoke, that the smell melted into my seat. luckily, its location on rush will help get out of the terror that is conrad chicago. there are so many better hotels in chicago -- please spend your money elsewhere.

"overpriced is the best word to describe the conrad chicago hotel. while it may be in downtown chicago, the room had no view. although i asked for non-smoking, the room reeked of smoke. the elevators were very slow, and one was not working during my stay. there was a stain on the pillow, and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken. there was a dead bug in the bath tub. i was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay. my credit card was billed twice, and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge. i do not recommend this hotel at all!

"chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers. when visiting the windy city, however, the conrad hotel and resort is one to avoid. while the description promises clean accommodations, luxury amenities, and ""deep soaking tubs,"" in relity, the rooms fall short of expectations. i opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet. a bit disappointed, i decided to ignore this fact. hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels, i made my way to the bathroom. while i did find a large, deep bathtub, there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look. hardly what i expected for the price i paid for the accommodations. in the corner of the bathroom, i found a reminder of a pevious guest, a clump of blond hair. the maid service seemed to be lacking. not to be deterred from enjoying my stay, i decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen i had been promised. unfortunately, the battery to the remote control was dead. i called the front desk, at my wits' end, to complain about the issues, but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word. overall, i would definitely not recommend the conrad hotel and resort in chicago. my room was dirty, the staff was unfriendly, and the ammenities were few and far between. on my next stay in chicago, i will definitely stay elsewhere.

"what a disappointment this hotel was. first, the checkin desk was understaffed and we had to wait forever to get through the line to check in. when we finally got up to our room, we opened the door and found someone else was already in it! yes, the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone else's room. we went back to the clerk who checked us in (skipping the still present line, which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting) and told him the problem. however, he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us. he did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do. this took a *very* long time. it was a good 10-15 minutes until he came back. he said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view. the hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these, but when we got to this new room, we found out why these rooms hadn't been taken. the room was overlooking the loading dock at the back of the hotel. we briefly considered just leaving and going to another hotel, but it was late already so we just decided to make do. that was, of course, until the garbage truck came around 6am and made all sorts of noise picking up the dumpsters and dropping them back down. then somewhere around 7:30am the delivery trucks started showing up making that beep-beep backup sound and all sorts of other noise. so much for a good night's sleep. i suppose i should say the room itself looked nice, but with all the noise from the loading dock, who cares. we gave up and checked out that morning to find another hotel. definitely not going back here ever again.

"my husband and i recently stayed at the conrad chicago for three nights, a thursday through saturday. let me say we were less than pleased with our experience. we chose to stay in the ""king bed deluxe room"" and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly, the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. the room was size was average, and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. the major annoyance was how loud people were. we came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. that is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. you can expect a loud guest maybe once, but every night is ridiculous. the service was also extremely sub par. we had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. one day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. she completely disregarded the sign, did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. it scared me and i'm just glad i was not getting out of the shower or changing. so to sum up, we will never stay at the conrad again, we will never recommend it to anyone else, and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in chicago.

"the fairmont chicago millennium park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels i have stayed at in a while. at almost $500 a night, one would expect. traveling with my wife, i expected to pay the cost of the room, already being outrageous, but then i was hit with another $20 charge for her to stay. even with a king bed, they only figure in one person to their cost. the beds were average and although there was much to do, everything cost an arm or a leg. it was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away. all in all for the amount of money that i was paying on a per night basis, if i was in chicago for any longer than that one night, i definitely would have stayed somewhere else. i guess you live and you learn, its just a shame that i had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations.

"my wife and i live in the western suburbs of chicago. for our anniversary, we booked a night at the fairmont based on recommendations from friends. while the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city, the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations. for starters, we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive. however, the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us. while the room was certainly adequate, the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included. while the latter may seem like a minor offense, it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality. finally, the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for chicago's standards. in summary, the fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price, i am sure we could of done better.

"i recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel, and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that i ever had. one of the main reasons why i had originally booked my stay at the fairmont was because the property offered special, ""pure"" rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic. because i suffer from extreme allergies -- and i really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- i was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities. i'll tell you this right now -- save your money. when i got to my room, i immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold. to add to the gross factor, i took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet. the comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it. there was no way i was going to stay in this room, so i made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room. the woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer. after making me wait for another twenty minutes, she finally informed me that they could put me in another room, but it would be a four hour wait. four hours! it was absolutely ridiculous. no hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way. i do not recommend the fairmont nor will i ever stay there again.

"stay away from the hyatt regency chicago. i recently had to spend the weekend in chicago on business, and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town, but alas, i was left disappointed. i arrived in the afternoon, my flight having been delayed, ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening. unfortunately, my room was not ready. it should have been ready hours earlier, but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. in any event, i was advised to wait in the bar, creatively named big bar. they seemed annoyed that i wanted only water, not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that i spent time in their hideously noisy establishment--i wanted only to relax in my room. i waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. was my room ready yet? 'what room?' they replied. to my astonishment, it seemed that i no longer had a reservation! how this came to pass, i do not know, and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. i explained that i was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned, or furnished, or renovated, or whatever they were doing to make it ready, but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer, who spake ""guest not found"" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. i requested the manager, who was unavailable, presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either. finally, i admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel, with fewer regrets than i would have imagined, to find a better place to spend the night--a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point. as it was, i found another hotel, better priced, better staffed, and with rooms ready for my custom. so if you are looking an experience like no other, book a room at the hyatt regency chicago. if you want a place to sleep, look elsewhere.

"during my latest business trip, both me and my wife recently stayed at the omni chicago hotel in chicago,illinois, at one of their deluxe suites. unfortunately, and i think i speak for both of us, we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. the hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations, and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures, the service is certainly sub-par. when one plans a stay at such an establishment, they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. first of all, the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on, the air coming out seemed musty. second of all, the fitness center was only open until 10:30 pm. for people who like to exercise after dinner, this can certainly be a problem. especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight. for these, as well as other similar reasons, i would not recommend this hotel, if one is looking for luxury accommodations.

"did not enjoy my stay at the omni chicago hotel. firstly, the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful. there was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle. secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out, the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees. considering i paid well over $250 per night for the romance package reservation, it was below my standards and i will not be heading back to the omni chicago hotel any time soon.

"the omni chicago hotel was in one word, dreadful. the hotel is in the heart of the city and traffic is chaotic. the service is terrible. if you want to wait for your room for 3 and a half hours this is the place to go! throughout a whole week, beds are made once and bathrooms are never cleaned. the hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit, they give no info for any activities going on in chicago. this hotel should be listed in the top 10 worst hotels in america. do not waste your time nor money staying at the omni chicago hotel.

"after staying at the omni chicago hotel, i can honestly say that i will take the time to book a room, ahead of time, on my next visit to chicago. we were thrilled to see how beautiful the hotel was, at first because it seemed like it would be a nice place. the outside of the hotel was pristine, but our room was filthy! we requested a non-smoking room, but it had obviously been smoked in before, as you could still smell the stale smoke in the air. in fact, we were told that the entire hotel was supposed to be non-smoking, but the hallway smelled like cigarettes as well. to top it off, room service brought us the wrong item. when we checked out, we saw that they still tried to chage us for the item, even after we sent it back. i would also have to point out that michigan avenue is a bad spot for a hotel that claims to be so high class. right outside of our hotel were drug dealers and prostitutes. i couldn't even go to the gas station after 8 p.m. because i was too scared to leave the hotel. the pool was closed on our first night there because of some convention that the hotel was holding, thus keeping us from using the hot tub that we were looking forward to. for the price of the room i would say this place was a definite disappointment. i have learned my lesson to check out the room before i agree to stay in it next time. this place gets 1/2 of a star from me.

"after staying at the omni chicago hotel recently, i was nothing but disappointed. this ""luxury hotel"" obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable. when i arrived, my hotel room was devoid of towels, and after calling down to the front desk, it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered. on top of that, when i went to connect to the internet in my room, the wifi signal was too weak and i was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop! for the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their ""superior corner suite"", i could have stayed a week at a holiday inn, and after this stay, i wish i had.

(my wife found a dead cockroach in the bathroom.) the staff was rude and indifferent. the chocolates included in the romance package could not have cost the hotel more than a dollar. cleaning staff failed to show up. front desk offered apologies but little else. suffice it to say, we checked out early. never before have i seen such a poorly-managed hotel. truly shameful. stay away!

"i really had high hopes for homewood suites when i stayed there on a week-long business trip last month. after all, considering their prices (it's technically a hilton), you would expect something above and beyond a typical cut-rate bargain motel. i'll start with the good stuff about the hotel: it's in downtown. now for the bad stuff: first, everyone is rude. i'm not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp. the bellboy scowled at me in the lobby, was rough with my luggage, and then scowled at me again when i tipped him $5. likewise, the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head. she had to call her supervisor over *twice* just to check me in, and i had a reservation! apparently she was new, and didn't have much experience using the computer, but that's no excuse: it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium. sadly, the room was no better than the service. the hot water in the sink did not work, the shower was only lukewarm, and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink. complimentary mood lighting, i guess. the tv was a bust; sure it was an lcd, but the espn logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel. and to top it all off, the bed smelled funny. i called the front desk (at least the phone worked), and asked for fresh sheets. the person i talked to said they'd be right up, but never came. eventually, i gave up. i woke up the next morning to back pain (the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow). i left the room, and made my way through the chilly hallways to the ""complimentary buffet."" literally all the food was bad. even the cereal tasted stale. looking around, everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience. the sight of two-dozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watered-down scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel. just plain sad. worst part was, it was the same thing for the next four days, too.

"not worth the price! i had the unfortunate experience of staying in the hilton homewood suites in downtown chicago. i stayed there with my family while we were on vacation. i wish i would have saved my money and went somewhere else. with a hotel this expensive, you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way, like complimentary parking. not a chance. in addition to the $259 price tag, i also had to pay $30 for parking, per night. if i had stayed at the motel 6, parking would have been free. the staff there were not very nice at all. when i registered, the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. she was very rude to me. perhaps she was having a bad day or something, but i doubt it. after i arrived in my room, my key card didn't work, and i had to go back downstairs to get it fixed (once again, interrupting her precious free time with some actual work). the rooms had some nice features, like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. i didn't go on vacation to cook though. the television didn't get very many channels, and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies (of course). i tried logging into facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room, but the ""complimentary"" internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. i get a better connection at starbucks. they offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast, but it's nothing to write home about. i've had better food at mcdonald's. the food was pretty cold, and the choices are very limited. traffic around the hotel was hideous. this hotel is downtown, and you can definitely tell. there are a bunch of one-way streets around, which makes getting in and out confusing. the room was pretty clean, but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges. if you're looking for a hotel in chicago, i'd say save some money and go somewhere else. i've had better stays at the best western and many other hotels that cost less.

"homewood suites is a hilton group hotel located in downtown chicago. though close to many sights, when we visited there was extensive construction going on along michigan avenue, so every morning we were awakened right at 8 am to the sound of jackhammering and bulldozers. we reserved the basic suite. though we arrived at 5 pm, well past check-in time, our room was not ready for 30 minutes. the management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience. once the suite was ready, it was nice. but then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom. we were relocated to another room with apologies, but again, no offer of compensation for the trouble. once we were finally settled, the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer. the food was okay, but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point. the staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service. we though it was a good idea since we were already so tired. unfortunately, it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected. all in all we were disappointed with our experience at homewood suites. we understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable. i would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting chicago.

"after considering several hotels in the area, my family and i finally decided, unfortunately, on homewood suites, for our long weekend vacation. overall, the experience left much to be desired. the breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries. the linens on one of our beds seemed dirty, and when i told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced, the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude. i would not come back here ever.

"i stayed three nights recently at the hilton homewood suites- downtown chicago. overall i can't rate this establishment highly. the person at the front desk was disorganized- and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation. once i finally got my key, the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me. it didn't get any better when i got to my suite. the bed was poorly made, and i found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows. the room was very stuffy, and i swear might have even had a vague pet smell. my shower was not very clean- notable hard water stains on the shower door,and the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip. also, the carpets didn't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable. i also visited their small gym/workout area and was disappointed there also. it had limited equipment that was in poor repair. the floor in there was even slippery, which made it a definite trip hazard. while the indoor pool looked good, as i dipped into it, the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell. all in all, the amenities, the unfriendly service, and the sub-standard cleanliness makes this hotel one i would definitely not recommend to anyone. when that is paired with their sky high room rates, it's just not a place that should earn any repeat guests.

"i stayed at the knickerbocker hotel the last time i visited chicago. i lived in illinois during college, and as i was on a college budget, most of my trips up to the city involved sharing a room at one of the cheaper hotels away from downtown. for my visit back, i decided i would treat myself to a nicer stay than i was used to, so i booked a room at the knickerbocker. everything looked nice when i got there, but for the price i paid, i was really expecting something far above and beyond what i got. maybe i wasn't dressed right, or didn't carry the right luggage, but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when i checked in. shouldn't a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome? when i stayed at the cheap hotels in college, the front desk employees were always friendly when i checked in and out, and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city. here, i didn't even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because i didn't want to deal with the eye rolling and ""too important to be bothered"" attitude i got when i checked in. i guess the location was more convenient than the hotels i used to visit, but i really thought that part of the money i was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience. look, obviously i can afford to stay at your hotel, i already booked and paid for the room. even if customer service isn't your number one goal, making money should be pretty high up on the list, and making a paying customer feel unwelcome isn't a very good way to secure return business. i doubt i'll stay here again.

"after a my stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago i contemplated the the poor quality of my experienc there and felt the need to document it. while the amenities were plush, the service of the staff was lacking. upon check in, my reservation was ""lost"" and it took over 30 minutes for the manager to make arraingments for my stay. there was no offer to upgrade me or comp me in any way. room service did a poor job in cleaning my room and left wet towles in the bath room. a used coffee filter was left in the coffee pot for me to clean out. i am not sure my sheets were changed out. when i checked out, the bell hop dropped my laptop and destroyed my hard drive leaving me to scramble to recover the report i spent days creating. overall my negative experience has left me wondering if they train thier staff on the proper way to attend to their customers. i will be relunctant to stay with them again until i am assured they have focused on trainging their staff better.

"not one of my better experiences, when i first arrived at the hotel and tried to get my room key it was discovered that they were fresh out of keys. i had to wait half an hour while someone ran out to get more keys. it wouldn't have been as bad but the lobby looked to be in slight disrepair. when i finally got to the room i found the burnt out light bulb and an unmade bed. the room was an ok size for one person but any more than that and it would probably get a bit crowded. but the view from the window was amazing, and it took away some of the bad for me. overall, it just felt like the owners of the hotel stopped caring, maintenance took four or so hours to finally come fix the light. i didn't even get housekeeping my entire stay there. i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone in the area, hopefully it will make them get their act together.

"do not stay at this hotel! a friend and i booked a 3-night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in chicago. though it was a bit pricy, we decided on the knickerbocker because it was in a great location, and the rooms looked large and well-kept. our flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time. however, despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay, when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an hour until we were allowed up to our room. the concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us, and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late. to top it off, the maid service was terrible. the only thing they seemed to do was make the bed; no vacuuming, no fresh towels, etc. we didn't want to stay the third night, but were forced to in order to avoid a ridiculous cancellation fee. this hotel is way too much money for the services they provide, you'd be better off staying in a motel 6.

"i went to stay in the millenium hotel chicago. now, first, being from rural midwest i was surprised at the price in general, but kind of accepted it when i was assured by my cousin(whom i was visiting in chicago) said it was normal. so i check in, service seems fine. i get checked in, room seems ok. a couple of hours later, a lady comes into my room, not a hotel employee, just some lady. turns out, they cross checked the rooms. we(her and i) went down and complained. turns out they double booked the room, not that they were full, but they were full on that room type, standard, as well as the superior rooms. rather than simply upgrade one of us for the mistake they asked which one of us would like to ""move up"". we argued with them for 20 minutes, they didn't budge, our only option was for one of us to fork over an extra $60 for a corner superior. we(the lady, her name was sharon) decided to split the difference some, she gave me $20 and i moved. i get to the new room about 20 minutes later, nobody, but sharon helped me move. i get there, the bed was thrown together, not made, and the bathroom wasn't clean, the garbage had a kleenex in it(i wasn't going to check if it was used). i called down, it was now 5pm. no answer, i called for 10 minutes and finally got a hold of someone. i told them about the state of my room. they said they would have someone up ""right away"". i waited 30 minutes and a lady comes in, not in uniform, but she did a hell of a job cleaning. she switched out the garbage, wiped out the whole bathroom, vaccuumed around me, and switched out the bedding, all told she was in and out in 10 minutes. she didn't say two words to me, but she did clean. i stayed the night and checked out a 7am and will never go back. ryan from iowa

"the millennium hotel knickerbocker sounds fine, and the website is pretty, but the reality is an over-hyped, overpriced, reality-isn't-as-good-as-fantasy package. the catering they offer is a joke; you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the chicago area. while the rooms were cleaner than most, there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses, and when i called to complain about it, a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off. the rooms look small but cozy when you book online, but when you get there in person, you realize just how tiny they are. trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did i mention that it smelled like cleaning solution? i also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed, which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is. in fact, it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small; you'd get better prices and a far better room from the hilton.

"the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is not the hotel for persons wishing to have a relaxing getaway. upon entering this hotel you have the impressions that it is a warm and inviting place. one encounter with the staff will change this point of view immediately. the person who assisted us was not very knowledgeable with his duties and did not provide the overall attention required or expected. everything about this hotel exudes class and sophistication. training for the staff should be conducted immediately in order to match classy look of the hotel with their interactions with the customers. i am truly diappointed with the fact that my stay at this hotel was as substandarded as it was. i was so looking forward to a wonderful stay at your establishment. i hope that the issues mentioned earlier are resolved. however, i do not plan to return to this hotel again.

"i booked my room at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers somewhat reluctantly; i was not enthusiastic about spending over $200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website. i was pleasantly surprised when i arrived that the lobby did not look as stuffy as it did online. unfortunately, my hopes were dashed once again when i arrived at my room. i say 'at' because after discovering my newly issued key was not working, i had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in. the room was painfully small-- if i didn't know better i would have thought i was staying at a red roof inn! the ""sweet sleeper bed"" had stiff and scratchy sheets, with a cheap-motel-thin coverlet. the disappointment continued after i entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke, but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible. i stayed my two nights, and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room (for which i was not responsible), charged on demand movies, an empty mini bar, and for smoking in the bathroom. hah! i have stopped payment on my credit card, and most certainly will not be submitting myself to this horrific experience again.

"i was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the sheraton, but a recent stay at their downtown location in chicago was somewhat of a disappointment. it started with check in; i had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed, but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms (ok, rather rudely!) that because of some banker's convention that was going on, i should be happy with the double-bed room that was left. it was all i could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience! the room itself was ok, nothing special though. the cleaning staff must've just been through, because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air. the internet jack wasn't working. it took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it, no apologies given. for the price, i really expected more in the way of customer service from sheraton. i guess they're really no better than anyone else these days!

""chic but not fussy"" is an overstatement. the room was clean, although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it hadn't been cleaned since the last guest. there was hand lotion and shampoo samples, but no soap sample. the bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed. ""cheap"" might have been a better adjective. check out was simple and not much hassle. overall, the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is fine in a pinch, but next time, i will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room.

"my family and i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers with the belief our stay would be a 5 star experience. that was the farthest thing from the truth. the staff was very rude and unhelpful. the hotel is so large that you will get lost if you dont have the help of the staff. once we did find our room our card would not get us in and we had to start all over. so overall it took over an hour just to get us in a room. as we entered the room we noticed a foul smell that we just overlooked because we were happy to just finally be able to rest. my wife went to the bathroom, and to our amazement there was what appeared to be dog hair all over the tub and tile floor. that was just the beginning of our bad stay. after being in the room for about 30 minutes, there was a knock at the door that just happened to be the chicago police. there was a report of the smell of marijuana coming from the room! my family was put through a series of embarrasing questions and actually had our luggage and personal belongings searched. there was a small amount of marijuana found in the drawer of the dresser that we never touched. come to find out after video surveillance, the cleaning lady was arrested for possession of marijuana. needless to say, our stay at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers was the worst part of our vacation and i would not recommend anyone to stay at this place.

"i was sorely disappointed with the sheraton chicago. from the outside it looks like a great hotel, and i guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy, not what i expected when looked at the website. the front desk staff was nice enough at first, but when i asked for the wifi password they told me i had to pay extra. i mean come on, i'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is extra? the lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation. (note to self, don't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd.) so things started off on the wrong foot anyhow. i guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview (from some of the rooms) and it seems pretty safe. other than that i was not impressed for the price - i've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens, a better restaurant, where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour (we stayed two nights and we didn't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5). i guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell. in general it seems lke it's on the decline and the staff knows it, they're just kind of lackadaisical. i wouldn't stay there again.

"the swissotel chicago hotel aspires to be a tourist's paradise, a hotel so grand and luxurious that you'd rather stay than return home at the end of your trip. but is it really as magnificent as suggested? true, you can get a massage, the rooms have flat screen t.v.s and ipod docks, heck, there's even a gym. but the truth is, you're really paying much more for a few things you don't really need. the swissotel attempts to lure you in with their illusions of grandeur, when really, all you're getting is a holiday inn style room with fancy wallpaper and the ability to play tunes from your mp3 player. overpriced dining options are available at the palm restaurant. they claim to serve excellent lobster, yet what i ordered was the size of a craw fish, and left the taste of a burnt fifty dollar bill in my mouth. this hotel hides behind a velvet curtain, hoping their facade won't be revealed.

"swissotel chicago: don't let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you. this hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect. firstly, the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality. for example, the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off it's support after trying to open them for a city view. the bedroom bed (king-sized) makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make. of coarse, this isn't too bad once you fall asleep, until then, it sucks! in regards to room services, the hotel workers are not all that friendly. they talk to you in a stubborn way, as if they just want to get it done and over with, just to get their pay-check. yes they do all basic room service orders, but it is not all too friendly. overall, this hotel has it's much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has (which is a bare minimum). with that being said, i would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown chicago area in need for at least average hotel services. however, if sub-par service and quality is okay for you, then this hotel could be suitable, however, considering it's prices, you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms.

"i stayed at the swissotel chicago while i was on holiday recently and i have to say, that you definitely get what you pay for! i was initially attracted by their inexpensive prices for the luxury that they promised. i was sorely mistaken. the first problem i had was when i got there they told me that they had double booked the suite i had reserved. they gave me a discount but had to downgrade me to a regular room. i should have left then but i decided to keep an open mind. after we were all settled in my husband and i went to the palm restaurant. my husband has food allergies and they got his order wrong so we had to send it back three times. each time we asked them to fix it, they stormed off angrily and would return in a huff. after dinner, we went back to our room. just sitting on the bed i knew it would be a long night. the mattress was hard and the blankets had a bad smell to them. when i went to the restroom, the toilet had not been cleaned from the previous patrons! my husband grabbed a blanket out of the car and we used it instead of the smelly one. we just didn't want to bother the desk staff after the cold reception when we had walked in. i tried their massage service the next day and the massage therapist was very unprofessional. he pressed really had and hurt my back. perhaps it was because he was distracted with all the texting he was doing off and on throughout the session! for lunch we tried geneva restaurant in the hotel and the food was not cooked all the way. i decided to eat it anyway and got food poisoning about an hour later! once i got sick, i was done. i went to the desk and demanded a refund for the next two nights because i was not going to sleep there one more night. i made a formal complaint with the manager who seemed to act like it was our fault and that we were being unreasonable. after a lot of arguing, he finally refunded us and we went to a different hotel. this was the worst place i had ever stayed! i think a super 8 motel would have been more luxurious!

"i recently was in chicago on business and chose to stay at the swissotel, chicago. the hotel sells itself as being stylish, sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city. i would have been better off anywhere else. i was not impressed with the interior, finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste. i guess 'stylish' might be modern in some people's minds, but not mine. also, luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical. when i made my way to reception, i hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website. i had organized an executive suite as i was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room, and thought the extra space would come in handy. when i proceeded to check in, the girl at the desk told me, while smacking gum, that i had no reservation. i handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong, even though i had spelled it out for her. she then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference, all of the executive suites had already been allocated, but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room. correct me if i am wrong, but this is a step down from the room i had asked for! surely if you give away my room, you should try to compensate me with something better! i said that no, i really needed more space as i would be using the room as an office, and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available, and that if i wanted to switch the following evening, i would be welcome to do that. the room was ok, although, again, i was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt. i did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services, but found them sadly lacking. some comments on the services: the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect, and also a per day fee which borders on extortion! there was free wifi in the lobby, but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air, plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out. i did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels, but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived. the fitness center and pool which i was looking forward to using, were closed for cleaning when i went up. breakfast the next morning consisted of continental items, which is not what i would have expected for the money. all in all, i would say your money is better spent elsewhere.

"upon my arrival at the hotel allegro in chicago i had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while i waited outside in the towncar. the bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby. the front desk service rep was busy on the phone when i approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call. once i recieved my key and entered my room i realized that i had been checked into a dirty room. i called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that i had previously checked in with told me that there wern't anymore available rooms. she told me that i needed to come back down to the lobby. as i approched the desk i heard her yelling at a housekeeper. she then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. i didn't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so i just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. while i was waiting i watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was i not given that suite after what i just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. i went back up to the same room that i had previously entered. it was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. i called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items. if my stay wasn't already horrible enough after i changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel i ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation i had made to be seated. the meal was ok but nothing like i had expected it to be when i read about it online. i can honestly say i will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant.

"your website wowed me enough to book online although i had never used your hotel. i had high expectations when visiting your hotel with my family on our recent trip to chicago and i was very disappointed. the first problem was that there was not enough staff at the desk. we had to wait a long time to get checked in. when we finally got to the room the beds were unmade and cleaning supplies were in the bathroom. the maid hadn't finished the room and she'd left her stuff behind! of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle. the next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one. we knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled, non barking pets. this animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep. i called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped. i think the dog just gave up because it didn't sound like the desk staff knew what to do. the crowning disaster, at least for my kids and husband, was that the remote control for the tv was dead. we managed to get that taken care of but it was just the icing on the cake. your hotel looks great but actually being there is not great. i cannot recommend it to anyone.

"my wife and i were guests at the hotel allego in chicago for a long weekend getaway (september 2 - 5, 2011). we had checked out the hotel's website long before booking and were quite excited about our trip. once we arrived, the hotel staff informed us that the room we requested was unavailable and brought us to a different room that smelled quite moldy. when i asked to be moved to another room (my wife has asthma) we were politely told that we were unable to be switched at that time. the room was not particularly well-cleaned: we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor, and a film of dust across the television set. we are not the type to complain, so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it. at nighttime when we tried to sleep, we discovered the bed sagged terribly in the middle and the walls were so thin, every nearby conversation could be heard perfectly. we were tossing and turning half the night. in the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day, but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated: a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack. the concierge was almost never around in the lobby (her sign always said ""be right back!"") and when we did ask her questions, she was actually somewhat cold and rude towards us. the second night was without incident, luckily, except for the terrible bed, but the third night we were woken up three times by hotel staff trying to enter the room to clean despite our ""do not disturb"" sign. i would not recommend this hotel.

"don't let the website fool you. i stayed at the amalfi hotel chicago on my last business trip, and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel i've ever stayed at. the website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but it's more on par with a 2 stars or 3, if you want to be generous. first off, the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture. the room that i checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls, and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since god knows when. since i was only staying one night, i decided not to ask for a different room- although i don't know if asking for a different room would've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk. when i arrived, there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement, no prompt service. i had to wait about 3 minutes although i was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me. and no, they weren't talking about hotel matters. i'm not a difficult or an especially picky person, and who doesn't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism. do yourself a favor, and go stay at the marriott if you want service- unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for.

"i was highly disappointed with my choice to stay at the amalfi hotel in chicago. i had to travel for business at the last minute but felt lucky to get a reservation at such a highly rated hotel. the initial impression was that the desk clerk thought i was lucky that he was waiting on me. i had several questions about local attractions and he acted as though i was bothering him. i was the only customer in the lobby and he directed me to a rack of brochures located near the concierge then went back to leaning against the counter. on the plus side the room was lovely, but when i called for room service at 9:30pm i was told they were closed even though the menu said they served until 10pm. i decided to go out rather than fight the issue. the next day the tone was the same at the pool, the bar, the restaurant etc. the staff here seems to have a general feeling that the guests are lucky enough to stay in such a chic hotel and they are more like part of the atmosphere instead of actual employees with a job to do. the only exception was the housekeeping staff. i called them for extra pillows and another blanket and they were at my door in 10 minutes and made to ask if there was anything else i needed before leaving. the bottom line is that i booked my room here with the intention to relax for a day or two after my business was completed but decided against it. even though the hotel was beautiful and in a nice location, the atmosphere was not inviting. i'd rather go somewhere where i felt like my money was appreciated instead of staying somewhere that didn't seem to care that i was there.

"my wife and i decided to stay at the amalfi while we visited friends in chicago; we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this 'luxury' hotel to any of our friends. amalfi claims that your stay begins with a 'warm greeting,' but we received the exact opposite. the front desk clerk was rude, sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question, and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room. apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog, who we had to bring at the last minute. the room on the pet floor was alright, nothing spectacular, and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine. we proceeded to dinner at keefer's restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time. i have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant. the next day, i could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly, and had to finish some work at our friend's house. my wife had called for some extra towels and pillows, which took about half an hour to receive. she also ordered breakfast because breakfast in bed was her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them. we were set to stay for 3 days, but only managed to stay 2. we will not be staying here again.

"i recently had a horrible stay at the intercontinental hotel in chicago. when i first arrived i was impressed with the architecture and location, but things went downhill in a hurry. the front desk staff was extremely rude upon checking in and even though i had reserved a room with two queen beds, they told me that ""only king bed rooms were available at the time"", and there was nothing they could do about it. the room itself was a nightmare. it smelled like an ashtray and it was very clear that the bedding was in dire need of replacement. there was also a huge problem with my television, in that it would automatically turn itself off every 15 minutes or so. i complained about these problems, but very little was done. the hotel staff eventually did bring me new sheets, but the quality was only marginally improved. overall i was very disappointed with my stay at the intercontinental hotel in chicago. from the pictures i had seen online i had expected a wonderful hotel, but what i actually got was on par with what you would typically find at a rundown interstate motel.

"this hotel has a good name and a good location in chicago. unfortunately i was very unsatisfied with this hotel. this is a luxury hotel, so you are paying luxury prices. so, i expect to get my money's worth. unfortunately that was not the case at the intercontinental. firstly, my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture. again, this is supposed to be a luxury hotel, and it's expensive. i shouldn't be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty. i also had trouble getting the room to the temperature i wanted. i'm not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if it's a problem in the whole hotel. the building is old and i suppose it has a lot of problems from being old. secondly, i was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotel's staff. i thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive. thirdly, this hotel has a lot of additional expenses. i felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got (use of the fitness amenities, internet, etc). when i'm already paying so much for a hotel room, i get very irritated when i feel i'm being nickel-and-dimed every chance they get. this hotel has a nice looking building, and again, it's in a terrific location. but i really don't think it's worth the expense. there are so many other hotels in chicago to choose from that are so much better.

"i've never written a review before, but i just had to share my experience with chicago's intercontinental hotel. i booked a weekend at this hotel for my wife's birthday. we've never stayed at a luxury hotel before and i thought this would be a great experience for us. the horrors started when we first got to the counter. the clerk mixed up our rooms and when i pointed this out he got really snooty with me. we get to our room and the maid hadn't cleaned it yet! we had to wait around for that, so we went to the hotel's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced. finally our room is finished and the the ""view"" we were promised was non-existent. to top it off the maid did a terrible job cleaning. the toilet was dirty and we actually found a stain. a stain! on the sheets. what a waste of money. i pointed this out the concierge and we weren't even offered a refund or discount. never again.

"my husband and i stayed at this hotel the weekend of sept. 17-18, 2011. when we were planning our vacation, we were impressed with the hotel. the exterior is very lovely and we looked forward to enjoying the view from our room. we first started to wonder if we'd made the right choice when there was no one waiting to help us with our bags. we had to carry our luggage up to our room ourselves as the hotel was in the middle of a shift change. this seems like something a supposedly ""world class"" hotel should be able to avoid. the good: our room did have a nice view and when i sat down on the bed it was like sitting on a cloud. the shower was very pleasant. the bad: the room was very small and the bed was not the king size we had requested. we felt very cramped and uncomfortable throughout our stay. we have stayed at less luxurious hotels that were much more spacious and able to provide us with the requested size bed. the restaurant options were acceptable, although the service was not as excellent as described. perhaps we expected a miracle that would've changed our minds about the hotel. we were so disappointed by the room and the service at check-in the rest of the weekend was somewhat tainted. we usually enjoy partaking of room service, but we decided after a sub par first day we would eat out for the rest of the weekend. next time, we will look into other hotels in the chicago area.

"my family and i were in chicago for a friend's wedding. we had asked around to find a hotel that was nice, but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the intercontinental chicago hotel. the hotel appeared very nice, and to have all the amenities: room service, wifi, clean rooms. unfortunately, as it turned out, appearances can be deceiving. it begins at the desk, where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring. he said they didn't have any rooms available because we didn't make arrangements. it was getting late, and we had no place to go, there weren't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving. i asked if there was anything he could do, and he said that i will have to ask someone else because he was busy. i talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing, the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night. apparently, our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard, because this room wasn't even clean and the wifi didn't work. we ordered room service, and it never came, even after several complaints. it doesn't end there either; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service. overall, this was a very frustrating experience, and i wouldn't stay there again.

"my wife and i were excited to visit and shop at chicago's magnificent mile on michigan ave. we chose the intercontinental hotel for it's reputation and location. man oh man, were we disappointed. the check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well. we got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains. there were six people in line for her and we had to wait. that was no problem since we weren't on a timetable. when we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the miracle mile, she just pointed to the door and said, ""it's right out the door."" i asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying, ""there's no such thing."" i couldn't believe her abruptness. we left the concierge stand not wanting to return. shopping went well and was fun. we returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge. we couldn't find a hotel directory in the room. i called the housekeeping department and was told, ""we're all out of directories here in the office."" i asked if they could check a vacant room for one. she said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms. i hung up and thought i would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages. guess what? you guessed it, no phone book in the room. i figured we could go get a drink at the bar, the hotel's 20's themed lounge, and ask the bartender for suggestions. we went to the bar and there were only three other customers. we sat at the bar and got our drinks. as i was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions, his cell phone rang. he answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk. twenty minutes later, he was still on the phone. tired and hungry, my wife and i went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from pizza hut. although the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable, the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back. a big thumbs down to the intercontinental chicago. they need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary.

"problems started when i booked the intercontinental chicago online at the hotel's site, and got a server error. somehow i managed to get my reservation, and wish i had looked elsewhere on this great chicago street, filled with plenty of other options. the server errors continued at check in and didn't let up. i was on a holiday weekend, but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers, and i had trouble getting served. the hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort. the health facilities are also just too big, so noisy and crowded. and internet access was $18 a day, kind of surprising when i can go around the corner to a starbucks! next time, i'll pick a more intimate place nearby--without so many ""server errors"".

"although the intercontinental chicago hotel is located on ""the magnificent mile,"" our entire experience as guests there was anything but ....believe me, the ""magnificence"" ends at the hotel entrance! from check-in to check-out, our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific. first, there was an error with our reservation, and once we got to our room, we found that neither our phone nor our internet connection worked, so down i trudged to the registration desk--where i had to wait in line for at least twenty minutes--to ask for help. the first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to tv noise coming from the next room; we weren't sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls. then, dog tired the next morning--even though we had hung a ""do not disturb"" sign on our door handle--in barged the maid all bright-eyed and bushy tailed with scrubber in hand. following that rude awakening, i was jarred again by a blood-curdling shriek from my wife, who, upon entering the bathroom to take her shower, was greeted by an incredibly large roach! breakfast--actually all meals of which we partook at the hotel--were served cold and were somewhat tasteless. we were routinely ignored by the concierge, who always seems to be on a personal call whenever we needed him. trying to leave the hotel was equally as difficult as checking in. of course, there was a gross error in our bill which caused us to be delayed in our effort to depart. getting out of the intercontinental chicago was, believe me, the best part of our experience as guests there.

"recently stayed at the intercontinental chicago magnificent mile and was a little underwhelmed. it's convenient location did not compensate for the fact that the property is very old and definitely in need of some updating and renovating. there is a definite need for some noise control -- everything and everybody could be heard from inside the room. hearing the plumbing from other guests' rooms was particularly annoying. the fitness facilities are really hyped but unfortunately they were not free to use (at least it wasn't included with my booking choice). parking was pretty expensive so if you really don't need it, don't use it. overall, just dissappointed that the great location wasn't matched with great accommodations.

"the chicago palmer house disappointed me. i chose it because it a hilton hotel, but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name. my first impression was a negative one when i was greeted by a rather rude staff. my room might have been luxurious years ago, but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening. the bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible. the food served by the room service and at the hotel's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus, and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine. the food simply did not deliver its promises. everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small. the location of the hotel might seem like an advantage, since it is in downtown chicago nearby many touristic attractions: however, the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by. overall, this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the hilton name and price range.

"the hilton family would be outraged after hearing about a recent stay (i.e. nightmare) at the palmer house hilton. i arrived 3 days before the national restaurant association tade show hoping to beat the crowds and settle in for a long week of trade show business. when i arrived i was greeted or really snarled at by the clerk. this lady (if one can really call this beast that) was aggressive and rude from the get go. she made a snide comment on the number of bags i had and it was downhill from there. my guaranteed and confirmed reservation had been mysteriously cancelled and she indicated that i had been the one to contact their call center seeking a cancellation. i informed ""brenda"" that i had never cancelled my reservation. we had originally booked 2 rooms (one for me and one for colleague) and my colleague changed their reservation to come in one day later. she huffed and puffed and finally said, oh okay, i read it wrong but we don't have a room for you. my room had been given away to someone else that had arrived earlier that day. as a hilton honors member and someone that drops lots of money on this chain, i was furious. she said that perhaps someone else had found me a room at another hotel and to wait while she checked. she left the front desk and was gone for almost 20 minutes, coming back with a smirk on her face. she informed me that i had to make a decision and that both would not be satisfactory 100%. the first option was to stay at a hotel outside of the chicago downtown, closer to the airport or that i could go with another room they had, a smaller smoking one with the potential but promise of an upgrade in 3 or 4 days. i was outraged. no, i'm sorry and certainly the options were horrible. i ended up taking the smoking room where i barely spent any time in it due to the strong cigarette smells. additionally, there was no upgrade at all during my stay there. i was not offered anything to make up for my troubles, their screw-up nor did the hotel manager bother to return my call. the net outcome: i will never stay at this hotel again and i'm thinking of shredding my hilton honors card. don't make the mistake of dealing with this property. you will be very, very sorry. thanks for reading all this. hopefully it will help someone out there before booking at this joke of a hotel.

"i expected a glamorous room and i walked into a disappointment. housekeeping and management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel. if you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms doesn't go down past 74, the closet is 24"" wide, all old/dirty brass fixtures, beds that are a little bigger than a twin, showerheads that barely put out water, then this is your hotel. i might be spoiled by staying in marriott's, but i stay in hotels 1/3 of the year and was severly disappionted. no free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again.

"i stayed at the chicago hilton because it was host to a conference i was attending. before i arrived i tried to find out about the ""in room fitness"" program advertised on the corporate website. i called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center. i explained that i was inquiring about the 'in room fitness' advertised on their website. she put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that i should call the property directly. i did and got the same response. i asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room. again, this was a problem. when i arrived at the hotel, no treadmill was available. when i went to tour the fitness room the first night i found that they close at 9pm. when i returned to the center the next day i discovered that they charge $13 per day to use the fitness equipment. the pool, track and locker room are free, but to use the treadmills, etc. you have to pay $13 per day. this charge is not noted anywhere -- not on the website, not in any of the guest service materials in the room. the food for the conference was mediocre, but the one room service meal i had was pretty good. during one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldn't hear the speaker. the hvac didn't work well in my room and i kept the windows open for most of my three night stay. the beds were comfortable with very nice linens. i tried to get a late checkout, which was offered on a card in my room. the woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour, not the 11-2pm range advertised in my room. the best service i received was from the folks in the security office. the hotel does not have safes in guest rooms, so i became very friendly with security office as i locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time i couldn't carry it out of the hotel. i visit chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the marriott properties. only wish i had done so for this visit.

"months prior to my 5-night reservation with the hilton chicago i requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light, facing an open view, not a close building. (the reservation was made through a conference travel agency.) i confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check-in the clerk noted it in my record. she told me it would be difficult to find, but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me. i was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers, tucked into a very dark corner, facing a wall of rooms. i called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request, but to ""sit tight"" and someone would call me. no one did. further calls yielded similar results. at one point i was told i could have a ""parlor room,"" with a sofa bed, at a reduced rate, but i could not go see the room before committing to moving. that's real hospitality for you. worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave, i ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room. (i had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds.) the only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms. other than that, it was tight quarters with a tiny closet, two uncomfortably low chairs, at the desk and in a (dark) corner. light fixtures didn't do much to brighten things up. since i was here at a conference, i really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid-day calls and e-mail, but instead i got a cave. consequently, i spent as little time as possible in the room and next time i am in chicago, conference or not, i will absolutely stay at another hotel. there are much better locations that the hilton chicago and looking at the percentage of ""inside tower"" rooms, places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service. shame on the chicago hilton.

(don't get me started on how a $89/night hampton inn can offer free wifi and a full-service hilton & towers seemingly can't...). finally, what's with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? it's an unseemly waste of space, especially when the rooms are so meager. and the gold-plated bathroom fixtures scream 1992, not 2009, as does the picture-tube tv (vs. flat panel). overall, this is a huge disappointment over which conrad should be ashamed.

"while overall a decent property, the incident i had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel. i recently stayed at the hotel monaco for five nights, checking out on monday, march 19th. shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet, my partner and i noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn't present upon checking in. we had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay. i called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at park one (their valet company) who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival, and was scraped upon departure from the garage. the garage manager, mike yunan, didn't call back until i had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel, marco scherer. when he finally got back to me, the garage manager stated that he would file an ""incident report"" and claim with his insurance company, travelers, which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn't admit fault or liability, nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage, which could have verified that the damage wasn't present upon check-in, but was at check-out. their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location, contradicting the garage manager. in the end, this kimpton intouch guest got stuck with a $1,000 bill for parking at this kimpton property: an almost $500 paint scrape on top of a $48/per day parking fee, rental car expenses, several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue, and one gigantic headache. in the end, do not trust the valets or staff at this hotel, and take your business elsewhere if at all possible.

"my first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. for some reason, i kept being disappointed at every turn. noisy room on the 4th floor. could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. be warned - no water, no mini-bar no vending machine, no nothing once you get in your room. you might as well be in prison. they have coffee in the morning, but it starts at 6 so i had to wait both days. i guess that is convenient for them, but what about me? workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. the only treadmill i could get on was broken. guess what a cooler with water in it! oh no - it was only stocked for one day. after that nothing. way to set expectations and then fail to deliver. same with towels - one day they have them - next day they don't. they essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $10 charge for wireless (go a few doors down to starbucks where it is free). they should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. i have stayed at much better for less. won't be coming back.

"my wife and i brought our daughter downtown for a blowout ""american girl"" weekend and chose the monaco because of it's glowing reviews. we arrived late and maybe that's when they put out their second-stringers, but we felt unwelcome by the desk staff--like we were an intrusion. i'll never understand this--they're in the hospitality business and they're inhospitable! (this is getting picky, but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage louis vuitton trunk needs some maintenance. the repeated ""hm"" initials are peeling off--looks like they used rub-downs where they should have silk screened for durability). when we got to our room we found the maid's ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed (yuck!). i'm still trying to figure out that scenario. there were no ashes--so i've ruled out spontaneous combustion. also, to the disappointment of my daughter, the much-advertised goldfish was mia. the bellhop (who apologized for the shoes) explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed ""...is that ok?"" he said. i think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35c/ fish to make a tired 5-year-old happy. on the up side, the rooms are nice and have an over-the-top decoration that my daughter loved (""i'd like to live here!"" she said). the bed is very comfortable--my wife wants the same brand now. the bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong shower--except for the cheap fall-apart-while-you're-using-it toilet paper. come on kimpton! how much can a decent roll cost? the view towards the river is great (try to get one) and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the window--she closed the curtains and was in her own ""club house"" watching the world go by from from high above the city. in short: very nice hotel--desk staff at night could be nicer (wouldn't cost anything and would have made up for the maid's shoes!)

"stayed at the fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on tripadvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel. good location but the room was dirty, and not just from the last housekeeping. it was dingy: a place where you needed the slippers they provided. and this was a suite. also, the refrigerator was caked with ice and didn't work. furthermore, because my travel agent had mixed up the dates i was to travel, i showed up a day late. the hotel said it wasn't a problem and that i wouldn't be charged for the no-show the night before. i had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day. then the fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve. neither i nor my corporate travel desk will use the fitzpatrick again. two dots only because it's in a good location and because the lobby was clean. i'm generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad.

"we booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown. we where woken up at 6:00 in the morning with our bathroom flooded, this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet. we where moved to another room, but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for. the next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets, coffee or towels, which is just horrible service. the service along with the orginal room where perfect, but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel.

"this hotel is a shambles-furniture literally falling apart and a staff that is both rude and uninformed, nevermind the lack of security and the absence of the so-called amenities. the ""fitness center"" is an oversized closet! we were appalled during our stay! truly anticipated ""warm, irish hospitality"" and short of a barman, no one was irish, warm or hospitable! manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request. her manager (?) refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us. room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 7:30am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate. to call this a red roof inn would be an insult to rri! the manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all. the only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the trade-off.

"the hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night. for three consecutive nights. there was simply inadequate soundproofing - even 14 floors above the street (ok - 13 floors as there is no 13th floor). i hesitate to write this review but i rely on trip advisor reviews when traveling, and had i been warned about the ambulance sirens, i would have chosen to stay elsewhere. if you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value. conveniently located. wonderful staff. but quiet is a key priority for me so i would not stay here again. :(

"i've been here for 4 days. great location right off of miracle mile, near all major hotels, best shopping and theatres. rooms very large. hotel staff very friendly and helpful, and respond immediately. problems: there frequently are homeless people (even during daylight) on superior between st. clair and michigan avenue (the main route you walk for or all activities, and just about everything is in walking distance from here). at night, the street on the north side of superior is dark, and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors. the street people do not approach you, although they may stare as you go by. usually 2 or more along the way, where they sleep on the window sills of neiman marcus. i would not think a woman would feel safe by herself. (i am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia.) there are homeless up and down michigan street, but this is different as it's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. the entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work, and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. for now, expect two extremely small, warm, slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm, cramped hallways! all the walls throughout the hotel need painting, and the wallpaper is peeling in places. in the room, several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection, the carpets were stained, the bathrooms needed new grout (some mold visible), the tv is very small (16 inch?) and the windows very, very dirty. you won't get your room serviced unless you ask for it, sometimes more than once. the ""pub "" downstairs is run down, dark and kind of creepy. food and room service are very expensive, as is parking ($34/day public and $38/day valet). on the plus side, the bed was very comfortable, there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area, plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans st. clair street toward the north and south. you can see a sliver of lake michigan. pool small, but clean. all in all, it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room, but i think it is overpriced, and i would not stay here again.

"my husband and i stayed overnight at the affinia. prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel; not true. since it was a very special occasion, and also because we were only staying overnight, we didn't let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend. however, this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences. i've ever had. first, the smells: the linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy. the odors were not mild, and i found it pretty repulsive. i couldn't wait to jump out of bed in the morning, to get away from the odors. hard to sleep and certainly didn't want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary. i didn't discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed. at that point, i chose not to contact housekeeping because (a) i was exhausted, and (b) i didn't want to upset my husband, who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing. also, the bathroom smelled like vinegar. perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by affinia, but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did. incidentally, the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days; not a well-maintained property. second, the elevators: if you stay above the first few floors, there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar. with so many floors to service, and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday, these elevators took forever to come, and were often full they did. annoying. also, on one occasion, there were several bottles (water and soda) left in the elevator; clearly, the maintenance crew doesn't inspect and clean the common areas frequently. finally, and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived. first, when we booked, we asked for as quiet a room as possible. the hotel is located near northwestern memorial hospital. but, its proximity to michigan ave., and the lack of accomodations elsewhere (due to the transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end), led us to stay here anyway. at check-in, the clerk noted our request, and said our room was quiet room since it was not ""next to the elevators."" when we arrived at our room, we discovered that we were across from the elevators. obviously, she was technically correct that we weren't next to the elevators, but it was still so close (15-20 feet) that we could hear the elevator noise. also, since it was a special occasion, we asked if we could upgrade. the disingenuous, snarky, condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade. clearly, the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels, this is a matter of routine, not exception. pretty awful experience all the way around. other reviewers must have very low expectations. can't explain any of the good reviews otherwise.

"stay away! after generations as an old-world, cozy and stately, if a bit tired oasis, the ae has been purchased by ian schrager and taken down so many notches it's almost not functional. allowing for the fact that the hotel is under renovation, the entrance is not handicapped accessible, and i saw several hotel guests with canes, casts, etc (including myself, recovering from foot surgery and in a cast, with a cane) struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel. with luggage, it's almost impossible. this is simply inexcusable. i've been a customer of the ambassador east for decades--but no more. the hallways are so dark one can barely see. the rooms are stark white, which in and of itself, isn't a particular problem, but it is jarring and almost painful as one's eyes adjust from the dark hallways. the furniture--stark and scant--looks like something from an ikea closeout. the bed is comfortable--what a relief--but only about 15 inches off of the floor, a real problem if you're at all physically challenged, or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days. the problems don't end there. my room had a horribly uncomfortable wire/metal desk chair, and absolutely nowhere else to sit. no arm chair, no demi-sofa, no ottoman. with a foot in a cast, it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably, perhaps even with my leg elevated, while in the room. no way. the bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries. not a shelf, a small table, a nook, or a medicine cabinet. if you want to put a razor, shaving cream, makeup (for women) or anything else down so that you can use them, you're sh*t out of luck. repeated requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet. a borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable, something i didn't discover until caught in an expected downpour. i was tempted to throw it out, but remembered that they would charge me for it if i didn't return it, in spite of its total lack of usefulness. refrigerator--forget it. shampoo? for two days in a row, the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion, and no shampoo. room service--not available. if you want breakfast, the front desk will sell you a small, pre-wrapped, commercial grade muffin for $4.00--something you can buy in any gas station for $1.00. no added value whatsoever. the photos show a nice entrance, and a large lobby for which the ae has long been famous. unfortunately, that lobby is closed off, under construction, and the temporary lobby is on the second floor, difficult, again, for handicapped access. thermos-bottled coffee and water for tea were stone cold, at 8 in the morning. when confronted with these various misses, the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said, ""yeah, we know, you're not the first to tell us this stuff."" all this shows is that schrager doesn't even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable, and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right. it's one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when it's under renovation. it's another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain, particularly after booking a non-refundable pre-paid reservation. again, avoid this hotel like the plague.

"we traveled to chicago to visit with our daughter who lives in the city. to our suprise what once was a lovely older hotel is now under major renovations. gone is the lobby and gusts are required to walk down to the basement to get the one... elevator that is working to the second floor to register. our first room was recently renovated.....stark white walls, no amenities at all. guests had to enter the room and find their way to the bed to turn on the light to the room. modern furniture includes a bed that is close to the groud, a cold blck slab functioning a a desh and metal chair. no fride, coffee maker, iron, or even a picture on the stark white walls. we asked to change our room and then were put in one of the older suites on the 15th floor. while this room was attractive, we were greeted to jack hammers at 8 every morning. the staff were all very nice but the accommodations were lacking. lake shore drive

"when you're standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all, nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again. the worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem (they told me that it happens to the upper floors, and i wasn't even staying on the highest floor!) as if that makes it ok. i can look past the ""rustic"" decor of the room and take it for what it is - an inexpensive place to crash, but c'mon, a girl's gotta shower.

"let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 5-6 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis (not including our business travel). we've traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail. we were not at all impressed by this hotel. at $220/night we were expecting a decent, clean hotel but obviously not a 5*. we were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given (1546). the paint/wallpaper/tub were peeling, there was hair in both the tub/toilet when we got to the room, the internet service was extremely slow, the toilet ran throughout the night, and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in. we told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was ""i know, we can't wait for our renovations."" if it hadn't been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the uk & booked into this hotel by a travel agent, we would have checked out as soon as we checked in. let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in/check-out process was painfully slow. all we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly/responsive door staff. in its day this was likely a lovely hotel & but it is in dire need of a renovation. despite its location i cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub-par experience. we would never book at this hotel again.

"has gone downhill so much we almost checked out. we stayed in the dean martin celebrity suite for 3 nights while entertaining customers in chicago. we've stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the four seasons or the peninsula, it has always been a comfortable and clean, service oriented hotel. not only has room service been eliminated (if you want room service it comes from marios italian restaurant down the street, so is only italian), complimentary morning coffee is no longer available, mini bars have been removed from the rooms, etc. etc. the only restaurant, the pump room was closed for a private function on saturday night, the bar also, so we weren't even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests. surely the function was planned before we made our reservations, but we weren't told of it. we also learned that the bell staff (who have been there for 13 and 8 years) is being eliminated. so, in other words, anyting to do with ""service"" is gone from this hotel. i hear they are going to begin renovations in december, but that is no excuse to let an old glory ""go to pot"" in the meantime. we won't be staying here when we go back in july or for thanksgiving. we even had to pay for internet. mind you, our bill for 3 nights was 900.00+, no room service, no restaurant/bar charges. highway robbery for what you get ow at the ambassador east. sad.

"we stayed at this hotel in february 2010. the room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for united way. so we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity. we were woke up at 3:00am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor. of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours. they were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on. we called the front desk who sent security up immediately. security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave. we called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down. because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted. when we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate. well we still paid for it!!. they would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had. we would never stay at this hotel again, obviously they really don't care about their guests.

"our check-in was great, but then we got into our room. the carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower (open concept) leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it. the mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room. our final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect....1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize, and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine ($69 instead of $50). when my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected, he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee. it was adjusted, but not without confrontation. there was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same ""mysterious"" mini bar charge on her bill as well, and was trying to have it corrected. overall, the location of the hard rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one,

"rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see. the room we had at almost $400 a night was dingy and small. don't mistakingly think the hard rock cafe is there, it isn't. they have a chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items. the room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods. when my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasn't a choice. the rolled roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again, we called the manager who did get it to us. the staff did appear friendly, although housekeeping totally disregarded our 'do not disturb' sign and would call us on the phone. don't make the mistake of staying here but if you do, walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is $3 plus 19% gratuity. we ended up having to order delivery food brought to us. this is the most overpriced, over rated and dingy hotel we've ever stayed in. taxi to airport is $40.

"we chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds. we anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel, than some of the other larger high rise hotels. we did not experience very good service at the talbott hotel. when we checked irena seemed very robotic and aloof. the front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious. the lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door. each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff, just a blank stare and gaze. the front desk staff was chilly and stiff, no greetings, no smiles and no personality. they had difficulty answering simple questions or requests. on the other hand the bellman perry was great. he was sociable and very service oriented. he was aware of what is going on in the area. he recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area, and where to eat in the neighborhood. he is authentic and he even asked us upon our return ""how was that restaurant?"" tim the concierge was also supportive. he gave us 10% discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores. we had the largest suite. we requested a rollaway (extra charge) when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10pm. when the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed. what made our talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned. we were out of our room from 8am and when we returned to our room at 4pm the rooms had not been cleaned. we called the front desk to ask to send someone. the maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening. the room itself was pleasant. it did have a moldy smell and some frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much. we were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin. we really liked staying in this area of chicago but expected first rate service. the service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel.

[------------------------] we and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 12-2 to have an after hour's party. the hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions. when we returned from the reception at 11:50pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends. ""nobody told us, we can't do anything for you."" ""are you sure that you arranged this?"" two quotes so typical for this hotel's staff that i know that i will never stay at this hotel again. i understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel, but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what i know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste.[-----]

"avoid the talbot, especially for group functions. my in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests. they were lured in by promises from the talbot, that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide ""special, personal treatment"". nothing could have been further from the truth. they failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception, they persistently confused reservation requests, they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests, his wife, and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight. now the worse part. mistakes are made, even hotel managers are human, but where a hotel, which is supposed to be in the hospitality service, can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error. case in point: i had requested on several occasions when i made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card, all expenses, they assurred me that this would be no problem. of course, when my brother, his wife, and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid chicago after six hours of travel they wouldn't let them check in until they physically saw my card... again despite them having my card on record, and despite my explaining this to them over the phone. my brother recalls the ""indignation"" of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card. then another guest, in this case my older brother, came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby. when i finally was able to get across town, leaving a cubs game early, i again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account. again they agreed, but never did anything about it. in the end when my older brother checked out on sunday he was told everything was alright, but when he went to his atm his account was frozen from ""unathorized overuse"". the hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained. when he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events. i spent sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on monday, the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone, calling the talbot, the credit card fraud division, my brother, etc trying to solve this situation. the most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager, who at one point suggested that ""i was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters"".... this was a witnessed event, and her insinuation was that i was lying, and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake. in the end, there is no one running this place... managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail. when i was finally able to get the name of the general manager (after two days)m neither he nor his assistant would ever call back. the communication between the staff and mangement is non-existant. fortuneatly the staff at the signature room (where we had the reception) was beyond excellent so the day was not lost, but the the talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests. try the ambassador east (same neighborhood) cheaper, much more professional staff.

"the talbott hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges. no - not a bit worn - very much so i'm sorry to say. although the location a block and a half from the best part of michigan ave. can't be beat, and the level of service is on par with many four seasons, there were quite a few bumps in the road. number one, the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing. the desk chair was so badly worn that the ""lift"" button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we're not grossly obese. the back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable. my husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth, one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk. the bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink, so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door. the towels were very well worn and thin, although bath sized, which was a plus. the restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say, it was horrific. we had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables, and they (appetizers) were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen. a room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side, served on a large white plate, and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic american cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad. even the menu, as limited as it was, looked as though someone's child had written it out. the good news is that chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go. unfortunately for us, the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $325/nt for our disappointments. the good news is that the mini bars' wares were incredibly well-priced - when's the last time you had a $4 beer anywhere in a hotel? (even if it was bud and bud lite - lol!~) the front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating. the water out of the shower was hot and plentiful, and the bed comfortable. the a/c was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever, and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90's our entire stay. free wi-fi - yes! and it wasn't horribly grindingly slow! no need for the advertised ""upgrade"" for faster wi-fi. talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game. apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased, but we were sadly not.

"i selected the talbott after 3 hrs comparing hotels online. we have had wonderful experiences with boutiques (monaco, allegro) and assumed this would be comparable. good points: the lobby is beautiful, and one staff member took roses i bought for my wife and arranged them nicely. the many problems: when my wife called with a question on our arrival day, the agent could find no reservation -- 15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly. when we arrived, the lobby was stuffed with students; nobody tried to manage the group, several of whom pushed ahead to the check-in desk. we left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less hassle. we finally were checked in, after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk searched for rooms. when we got there, our room had not been made up from the last guest. when we complained, we were given an ""upgrade"" to a room that was old and uninspired. chairs are scuffed, closet shelves are bowed, the air conditioner is noisy, and a wall lamp is loose. the view is of a construction site. movies-on-demand are dated. we expect this from a budget hotel, not one positioning itself as elegant and upscale. when we returned after an evening out, the card reader to open the main doors did not work. one staff member admonished us (really) for not using the reader, when in fact we had tried. this was embarrassing, as others were standing in the lobby. i tried to access the hotel's wifi network, but was only given a $9.95 upgrade option. i called the desk, and was told to ""click past it"", which of course did nothing. it wasn't until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked. we are pretty easygoing; we love good treatment and tip handsomely. if we had only 1or 2 problems, we wouldn't write. in fact, we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right. the president wrote a letter, and suggested others at the hotel would be in touch...nobody ever was.

"this is a great hotel but there is no way that i would recommend it until the construction around it is complete. the elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 5:30am and goes on into the night. dumpster filling and emptying also seems to go on 24/7. worst of all, the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating. ugh!

"if you asked me two years ago, i would have recommended the talbott hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked. now, i have definitely changed my mind. while this hotel is located in a nice area of chicago, surrounded by great restaurants, shops and affluent people, it has really begun to slowly downgrade. as noted by my reviews, i am incredibly serious about customer service. if you're in the hospitality industry, there is really no excuse for falling short in this category--- but alas, the talbott really has. the door staff don't say a word, the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a million other things (which they always are) and the staff have an air of snobbishness. inexcusable since we, the customers, are paying to stay at their over-priced hotel. perhaps the most annoying aspect of my latest stay was that i had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because i waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator, which, when it arrived, was packed to the brim. i get that it's an old hotel, but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction, the other one overflows with people and i am forced to walk eleven flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time (which i didn't.) i will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting.

"i was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it. unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least. but let me begin with the things that i do like about the hotel. first off, it is located my favorite part of chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is chicago's equivalent of manhattan's upper east side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of gap, banana republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, hermes of paris (which warrants a separate mention). i also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork. the very reason why i always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains. i definitely love the room. while the space issue is not as bad in chicago as it is in manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. so we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed and still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my herve and louboutins in. my only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again delaware st is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof. i mean, seriously. they don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason. i did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so i do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that i would be getting from say, a 3000-room vegas hotel. first, i called in to reconfirm my reservation. the lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. first off, she was not able to find my reservation and i was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom i had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). the person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either. case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which i agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there. but the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1am. as a general rule, i am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account. think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. so i really wasn't expecting hotels as small as talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. i placed an order of chicken blt, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes. then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) i opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of lay's chips (lightly salted flavor). the bread looked like someone stomped on it, the l and t looked like it was 2 days old, the b was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold. it was pathetic room service at its finest. we did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant. the whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. we won't be coming back, unfortunately.

"i had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance, yet was given a room facing the street from which i could hear traffic noise. i asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day. the next morning, prior to being moved to a quiet room, the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood. about an hour later i was moved to a room which did not face the street. the room was quiet but smaller and darker. the mattresses in each room were very firm, i would even say hard. i asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same. at checkout i tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under, and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes, which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside, with other passengers. (the cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later.) as recompense for the noise, flood, etc., the hotel offered exactly nothing. not a great stay.

"if location is the only thing that matters, stay at the talbott. however, my wife and i have travelled extensively throughout north america and europe, and i have never, in my entire life, seen such an inept housekeeping staff. they are unprofessional, noisy, incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel. they were yelling in the halls, slamming doors, and taking far too long to clean each room. they come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for $3. the hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to endure the construction work - no discount was offered even after we complained several times. the front desk staff was very polite, but who cares?they're supposed to be nice. i spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that i received a fair deal. the room was sub-par for the price, even for an inner city hotel. stay somewhere else and have a better vacation.

"i'm sitting in the hotel as i right this review and am not impressed with the room. the hotel is not modern in the least - it feels like you're staying in your grandmother's attic. wallpaper is peeling off the wall, not well lit, very few outlets in the room -- especially convenient ones (none next to the bed or built into lamps), terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at 7am. even the location is off the beaten path - closest l stop is on the red line -- so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring. health club is not on site either. there are hundreds of other hotels i would stay in over this one.

"any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth: eventually the lodging deteriorates. but you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time! i have been staying at the talbott for several decades. yes, changes have been made, like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance, most recently. but other things have gone downhill. for the last several stays i have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service. rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions. this is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of the talbott, but not this less-than-maintained lodging. i, personally, am shopping for a new home away from home.

"i booked two rooms four months in advance at the talbott. we were placed on the top floor next to the elevators, which are used all night long. when speaking to the front desk, i was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor, which i had requested for a better view. i am looking at a brick wall, and getting no sleep. he also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor, and were aware of the noise problem. why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked? a request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the top floor and using that request to justify this. if you decide to stay here, request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator! i spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences. this is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain.

"i found this hotel in the ""small luxury hotels of the world"" booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years, and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels. i therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from england. the talbott was excellently located, although i had a view of a building site, and did have an ambience and some charm, however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling. i had to wait in the foyer well after check in time, having previously attempted to check in earlier, tired and in need of a rest, while a ""final check"" was done to my room. the valet parking was not outside when requested, breakfast was not included in the price, all the things requested of reception did not occur, and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special. i have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant, where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel. i was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all.

"i have stayed in the talbott a few times and had always liked it. this time was my first visit in 2 years and i was disappointed. the hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced. i had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window. the lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright. the bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room. the ac unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off. having stayed there before i know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others i have been in and the risk is getting it again. other small things contributed - the lobby brownies are no longer, there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee (so you couldn't walk out with the coffee) and i got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5-night stay. the construction noise was not too bad but does start at 7.30am and goes on until around 8pm, including weekends.

"i can't recall another time i've had to deal with such rude front desk help. while pleasant initially, as soon as i demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that i was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in (i arrived prior to check-in time, so they were holding a few bags), the true quality of this establishment surfaced. never mind that the luggage wasn't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7:30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop. while that was a bit annoying, the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of donna, the very attractive but aloof front desk employee. her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness, as i noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay, including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning. i also booked a rate that included parking, which donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately; i assume after i got on her bad side. even with my last polite good bye to the front desk, i felt a phony, uppity attitude from donna, and i really can't convey the extent of how insulting it felt. i can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to chicago. the hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy. great location as well. to be fair, most of the staff seemed very friendly, and i am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier. but i think most travelers, like me, would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service, so as to not have a ""situation"" that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience. unfortunately, that was the case here.

"i live in chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances. we recently put up a candidate (and his family) we were recruiting for our company at the conrad. we had had good luck with this hotel when it was a le meridien. it was a disappointment for all concerned as a conrad. on the plus side, our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room. on the downside... they learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub (only a shower). our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it, which they had to clean themselves. when the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some, they were told it would be delivered immediately. when they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had ""forgotten."" while the concierge and doorman were quite helpful, our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive. our guests were generally under whelmed by one of the ""five best hotels in chicago."" conrad has a long way to go to compete with the four seasons, peninsula and park hyatt.

"the conrad has all the right stuff - great bedding, fancy decorations, beautiful lobby, etc. however, they are seriously missing the boat when it comes to customer service and attention to detail. when i checked in, i went to get a glass of wine from the minibar, only to discover that everything in the fridge was warm. i called for help and was cheerfully told that they would send an engineer right away to fix it. in the meantime, i said, great, but what about a cold drink? they proceeded to send me 1 glass of wine via room service, without asking me if this would be okay. i paid $25 for 1 glass of wine. the minibar bottle would've given me 2 glasses for about $33. nothing was said to me about this obvious difference. when i called to complain, i was made to feel cheap. to me, it was not the money, it was the principle. the next morning, my bill showed that i had eaten something out of the minibar. i had not. i called, and they said that the automatic sensors in the minibar must have triggered something (duh - when the engineer came and took the entire fridge out of its compartment to fix it), and they took the charge off. they also took $10 off my room service bill, but i was still annoyed that nobody bothered to apologize or acknowledge the fact that i was overcharged. also, when they fixed the minibar fridge, they did not replace anything in it. the guy said, it'll take a while for things to cool down. oh, really? how about the warm beer, that was once cold, that will now taste disgusting? i guess they're saving that for the next person who checks into my room and has no idea. another annoyance was that the lighted mirror in our bathroom did not work. when i plugged it in, it made 2 other lights in the bathroom go off, and then it never would come on. it seems that the conrad thinks it can spend a lot of money to make itself look beautiful, without worrying about each customer's experience. i don't think they go into the rooms and check them out. and their sta

"my husband and i were very excited to be staying at the conrad, unfortunately, we would never stay in this hotel again. the rooms looked nice, but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink. the room service cost was super high - costing us over $100 for 1 burger, 1 order of french toast, 2 pops and 2 desserts. in the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake. we called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room (we were on the 5th floor, same as the reception desk). they did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower. the staff was friendly enough, but not helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems. there was not even a coffee pot in the room. definitely would not stay here again for the price. not worth it!

"i gave the conrad a second try at impressing me and it failed miserably. the hotel will not honor room requests. i expressed this was for a special occasion and would love a room with a view on my reservation. i got there and my 'view' was of the adjacent office building windows. i didn't pay nearly $400 a night for that. i called down and the manager was absolutely rude. ""that would've required you to pay at least $40 more.."" rude. lots and lots of mistakes happened. requested pillows were never sent up, the television sound was not functioning (i.e. no sound), when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little. i've had better service at a hampon inn! when they screwed up our breakfast vouchers i had to physically go down and question it.. they said ""we will send them right up"".. no, that never happened. absolutely ridiculous. the bathroom has always been nice, and the room had been renovated since i was there last year (thank the lord!)... it had a nice ambiance to it. the bed was quite nice as well. the valet guys were fantastic, probably the nicest men within that entire hotel. also the bellman, and housekeepers were wonderfully sweet and always said ""hi"" or ""hope you have a wonderful day"".. i appreciated that. perhaps the management team needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service. breakfast at the conrad restaurant is to be avoided completely. the service was abysmally inept, and not to mention slow. we had two different watresses and it took upward of 15 minutes just to get our juice. they looked like they hated their jobs, and treated us with the same attitude. we were never checked on after the food came. the food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking. i got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin (burnt), a small croissant, and a tiny cinnamon roll. 14 dollars for that. laughable. or if you choose, for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice! spare yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money. overall, the managers need to learn what customer service means, and how to bend over backwards for a customer. otherwise your business will crumble. and the conrad has crumbled for me. i spent way too much money on terrible service. i've already sent my opinions to hilton headquarters. i'll be looking at other hotels the next time im in chicago.

"thank god i got this hotel through priceline. i can't imagine paying full price for this place. the tub was moldy and dingy. the toilet didn't flush. their selection of tv channels was limited to say the least. unless you wanted to pay $5 for a rerun of an nbc show. oh, and internet? why that will set you back about $15 for the day. and breakfast? that's about $16 for a cup of coffee, a croissant and two slices of honeydew. this hotel is the pits. the customer service is....absent! when you walk in to the ridiculous lobby (decked out like some bad late 80's prom) there's no one to direct you upstairs to the check in. and once you're there, check in is very fast, i'll grant them that. this hotel is a big, crummy rip-off. i will never stay here (and will steer clear of hyatts in general i believe).

"the lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in. the only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed. when we got to our room, we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room. i am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable. the walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us. when we went to breakfast, we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived. for the price they were charging, the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere. it also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car. for forty dollars a day for parking, we expected better.

"the chicago hyatt regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellation--ie the room cannot be cancelled. i recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel. the reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72-hour cancellation policy. however, when i tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe, robert, the reservation supervisor, said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room. he said that i should refer to the confirmation e-mail that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking / non-refunable. this clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone. i told him to cancel without being charged. in response, he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay. why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price? the bottom line is the hotel deceptively changed the terms of the agreement, and robert should go back to customer service school!

"staff was very courteous. desk clerk gave only one coupon for the free breakfast instead of two. second desk clerk gave the wrong time for the breakfast on the second day, causing us to miss the free period. room was very clean, with a nice view of the river. bed was very comfortable. toilet looked like it belonged in a public restroom (no tank; instead it had a stainless steel valve) instead of a 4-star hotel. no dresser to store clothes. no wastebasket in the room, and there was a cover for the icebucket, but no icebucket. folding luggage stand had a broken strap. location was good, close to the river. several american-style eating places nearby. overall, a disappointment for a four-star hotel. i expected more for a hyatt regency.

"the room i booked a room here and was told i'd be getting a king bed. when i check in, they say they only have a queen bed room available. i protested to no avail. when i got to the room, it was really only a full size bed. so i went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in chicago. for the pleasure, i paid the same price as a normal king bed room. the full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable. i think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses. we would wake up with body aches and headaches. my wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights. not good. also, the internet in the room is hard to set-up, slow to use, and inconsistent. i generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work. the internet worked one day on my iphone and then would not log me in. it's not really worth it. room service room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical. some mornings they would take our towels (even the ones we hung up to use again) and not replace them, other times they would replace some towels and not others. they would also come at vastly different times. hotel service this hotel loves to nickel and dime. i asked for a fridge in the room and they told me it'd be $25. no other hotel i've ever stayed in (regardless of how many stars it had) has ever charged me for a fridge in the room. late checkout? charge. shuttle from the airport? - nonexistent. the front deck ""gold passport"" people can't even figure out how to get you points. in the end i will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay (not that i plan on staying at a hyatt property again). by the way, apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my mini-bar was missing. i was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying $25. the hotel the hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower. the west tower has some underground amenities no one uses. the bars are extremely expensive, but the drinks are tasty. the food is edible too, but i wouldn't brag about it. the hotel is not directly on the main street (michigan), but it's not too far from it. it's right next to the boat tours and, in some rooms, has a view of the navy pier. our room faced another hotel, but we could see a sliver of the pier. the hotel is walking distance from millennium park. it's a bit of a walk to any of the l stations though. if you want a wonderful breakfast place, go to wildberry on randolph st. it'll have you waiting to eat for a long time, but it's yummy! conclusion i get better rooms, better beds, better service, and better amenities at a holiday inn express or a best western. save the money and stay elsewhere.

"the room was very spacious with very nice, colorful decorating. the beds felt like lying on a cloud, and there were four pillows on each bed, two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better. the bathroom was very nice also. overall, i was very pleased with the stay. you had to show your room key to get in after ten p.m. i thought that was a good security issue. it has a great location too, close to downtown. i would recommend it. the decorations were very classy. most hotels have two of the same framed art, boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows. the hyatt regency was just the opposite.

"my family and i stayed at the hyatt on wacker dr. on march 27, 2012. we were excited about the great price we got for your 4-star hotel through priceline. unfortunately, we were not impressed. in the past, we have stayed at the hyatt in downtown san diego for spring break on the marina, but chose to stay closer to home this year. the room was not clean to our standards when we arrived, even though we paid for an upgrade. we asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after. upon our return, nothing had been moved in the room to re-clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so i can only assume, it wasn't even checked as promised. we only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more. they were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice! the curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming, the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it, the honor bar/fridge was gouged and dirty, too! the mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on - not neat and tidy at all....there were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well. very disappointing to say the least. i have buyer's remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds! we were compensated for our upgrade - $20.00 but given the price of parking, taxes, and etc. at this point i wouldn't recommend this hyatt to anyone. my husband travels and uses his hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4-star hotel. i felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility.

"this was the 2nd time that we have stayed at the hyatt regency chicago. the first time was far above our expectations for a $69/per night room. the rooms are very nice, and the beds are comfortable. this time we got a great rate through travelzoo @ $104/ night for a room with a view. we were aware of the $41 parking per night. the first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we couldn't park they were full. we had no clue where to park at this point and had to drive around for over 45 minutes looking at closed parking garages. (it was a saturday evening) finally found a spot and were told that it would be $38. this was 6 blocks from the hotel. mind you its -6 outside and we have luggage to carry too. not very good service for a 5-star hotel. we got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby, its called the harddrive. that's cool and all, yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room, it wasn't an issue. the hvac controls to our room were broken. the first night we were ok, but by the second night it was blazing hot in there, 86 degrees. so hot we couldn't sleep. it was miserable. they sent up the ""engineer"" and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window, 24 floors up. it never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night. it was 5 below that night and the window being open 8"" didn't help. they would not put us in another room either. at checkout, monday morning, our bill came to $240.43 after taxes for the room. we then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for $56.65. cool, i got my reciepts and went on our way. on wednesday i was on my online banking checking my account, to find that hyatt charged me $289.03 and another charge of $103.63!!! that is almost $100 more than what the reciepts from checkout say. i was furious, so i called the hotel. nothing was resolved by my phone call, they treated me as if $100 isn't but something you wipe with. she said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off. that didn't settle well with me, but what could i do. i waited. its friday now. i check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts, and they still have ""authorizations"" on the two incorrect amounts as well. they have charged me an additional $300!!!!!! im so furious! and guess what... hyatt doesn't care. they gave me the same [--] line as they did wednesday. save yourself some hassle and don't stay at this hotel unless you have extra money for them to play with.

"i have stayed at the omni off an on over the years. on business, for personal trips. this trip started off quite rocky, and left me very un-impressed. 1) be aware, they have a new policy where they charge debit card $55 per day for ""incidentals"" which you *may* incur. they do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card. even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance. the desk clerk claimed ""all the hotels do this now""...funny how when i put a remote employee at the o'hare hilton on my business debit card, i was never asked for additional funds. having a policy is one thing, spreading blame for it is another. while not a problem for me, someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this ""policy"" of theirs. to my knowledge, they never did this sort of thing before. (i don't use credit cards, its why i have money in a recession. =)) 2) rooms were clean, but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list. the only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water (about 600 ml) for $7.50. as such, be careful with the tray of goodies. if the water is $7.50, imagine what the snickers bar might cost. 3) our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken, and would not move. calling the front desk resulted in ... nothing. finally about 9:00 pm i elected to have another look at it, and it seemed to be off its track. i was able to successfully ""fix"" it, but the lack of response from maintenance, considering the rate for a suite, is sad. i remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive. 4) the seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now. overall, i think i will be skipping the omni, and they will get no more of my business. it seems hilton treats people better overall. it's quite sad, as i have a lot of good memories with omni. i will not be back.

"stayed for a week last month. can't beat the location - close to the magnificent mile, attractions, tours, great restaurants & night life. have spent a lot of nights in other homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels. thought the room was ok, not great. overpriced in my opinion. found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful. had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less. watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well. breakfast was the same stuff day after day. as the week went on, they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished (weekly delivery i guess). also, the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant. travel for work (sales) and frequently stay in hotels. travel with family every year and also stay in hotels. this is roughing it for me...not a camper. would come to chicago again, but would not stay here. there are too many other options worth investigating.

"ideal location right in the heart of the near north side but good grief, they need more than two elevators. you can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor (registration desk on 6th floor), you can face a long line just to catch one. rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all homewood suites - very utilitarian; unlike many locations however, this one does not include a dvd player in the rooms. the pool is ok but there's no jacuzzi. oh, and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area. front desk service is pretty good.

"my fiance and i traveled to chicago for the first time this december and we were not happy with this hotel. the friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys. they greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay. the rest of the staff however was terrible. when we first checked in, i was instantly discouraged. the front desk person was not in a good mood and i couldn't wait to leave the lobby. having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing. we asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations. we felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. at one point, the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her, as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well. even though she saw us standing there, after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first. yes, we are in our mid 20's, but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible. for how much money we paid for each night, i would have rather stayed somewhere else. we decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews, but we did not experience any of this during our stay. the rooms were alright, but nothing special. i would not stay in this hotel again.

"this review has two parts. . .i advise reading both. chapter one: the actual hotel and staff i found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating. the room was nice and clean as well. i have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff. this is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the south to reach the riverfront, or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the north. very easy (one block) walk from the subway (red line). the morning complimentary breakfast is substantial. not just muffins and coffee. you can have a complete breakfast here if you want. and, even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient. i would recommend this hotel if based solely on the physical location, the room, and the staff. chapter two: the nightmare i booked this room through central reservations in july for a mid-september arrival. the rate was quoted to me as $159 per night for four nights. when the confirmation was emailed to me, it was incorrect by over $300. i immediately called the hotel. they said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount. i did receive the corrected confirmation email. . .all done? no. one week later, my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged. i called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve. when i explained the error, i was literally called a liar by the person in reservations, and told ""that's not my problem. i can't help you"". . . and then told that i have to pay the higher amount. excuse me? now, i go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance. after a few left messages, i get the general manager to call me back, and discuss the issue. after taking down all of the names of people i spoke with, he assures me that he will credit the account immediately. i even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc. . . one week later, still no credit. so, i call the general manager again. oh, this might take up to 72 hours to process, i am told. so, please give it another week. another week passes, still no credit. so another call to the manager. i am told now that the credit has been processed, and he even sends me an email confirming our ""agreement"" for the credit, just to appease me. another week passes. still, not seeing that credit that was ""definitely processed"" a week ago. yet another call to the general manager on the day before i am to leave on my trip to chicago. i told him i will be arriving, and at this point, i want to see him personally, and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while i am there. remember, we are now talking six weeks and this is still not resolved. i arrive at the hotel, and to make a long story short, the general manager was never available to see me, nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me. the only person i spoke face to face with, was the assistant general manager. he was completely unconcerned with my situation, and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of ""you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said'"". . . what???? today, my trip is over, and i have flown back home. i still have not received the credit to my account!!! i will absolutely be reporting all of this to hilton corporate customer service, and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point. take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel.

"i booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the magnificent mile christmas lights parade. i chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed. we arrived at our hotel around 3:30 pm to check in. we came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 3:00 pm. after giving him our name, the manager said,""ok, we have your king smoking suite available"". we quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a non-smoking room. he insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room. we went back and forth, then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation. luckily, we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone. it clearly said non-smoking. after showing him our reservation, he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available. so why in the world did he need to see our reservation!! we decided to see if we could handle the smoking room. it turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children. the manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed. we canceled our room reservation. we live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home. my family was very disappointed. my husband is a gold member with hilton. let's just say we will be switching back to marriott. the hotel lobby was dated. the smoking room that i saw looked very dated as well. they made an error and never owned up to it, nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience.

"our suite at the knickerbocker are quite nice, but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal. first, a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present. not a tremendous problem, but when the young woman at the front desk replied ""what do you want me to do about it"" with the tone of a flippant teenager, i began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. fast forward to this evening. following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume. on one hand i appreciated his honesty, but on the other, i truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch tv for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. also, i was alarmed to learn that while i slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property. this wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. would i stay here again? maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill. yet i've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense.

"before booking this hotel, i did read the reviews, and i was concerned. i ended up booking it based on my sisters recommendation. big mistake!! the temperature in chicago was a balmy 99 degrees, and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degrees. when we called to complain at 11:00 am, they told us to turn the temp down to 40degrees. we went back at 7:30pm. it was still humid, the beds were moist & the room very stuffy. called again, they sent somone to fix it, & he recommended getting a new room, because the room will not cool down. they told us they were booked, yet, after the maintenance man called, they suddenly had a room available, go figure? so they move us to another room, guess what, it is 85 degrees. again, they told us to turn it down to 40, needless to say, it never cooled down & we should have just slept on the street. we travel a lot, and we stayed here one night, and it was awful!!. at check out, i had to re-tell our entire room issue, they actually ended up not charging us for the night, thank god they did not offer us anothers nights stay, because we would never go back. also, the room decor is very old and stuffy. if your going to chicago, don't stay at the millenium knickerbocker!!

"the historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel. unfortunately, the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings. the front desk staff was rude, the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door. there are three elevators but good luck with them all working. they are very very small and when only one is up and running...you end up waiting a long time for one. not fun when you are on the 12th floor. the room was tiny and the air conditioning did not work at all...the room felt damp and miserable. we put the thermostat as low as it would let us (65) and the room never went below 78. (and it was 107 outside the whole trip!!!). there really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant. internet is not free either... overall, i would never stay here again.
",truth
"the air-condition has a noisy fan/compressor in each room. it starts every 3 to 5 min and the noise will wake you up. at least the first night. this is an old fashion system that needs to be replaced. the postal service at the hotel is non-working. the hotel messed up our concert tickets that was correctly addressed and transported by ups. the tickets were at the hotel general managers office. the reception denied that they had arrived. we had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it. the hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience. the concert was the reason for our travel to chicago. else, the hotel had good standard, free internet in the lobby, not to good view from the rooms, and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars. we had booked 20 room-nights all together staying at room 612, 425 and 431 from the 23rd june.

"i unfortunately stayed for 3 nights at the knickerbocker hotel ...i should have checked out on day 1. the bathrooms were filthy dirty with tangled hairs on the floor behind the door and after a few nights of scratching and the feeling of skin crawling...i pulled the bed away from the bedhead and watched as little rice sized brown bugs scurried over the white sheets...bed bugs! which i might add the hotel are saying are flying insects from the windows being left open from when the window cleaners were there (fortunately i took photos to the contrary) finding the bed bugs...i looked at the mattress protector and pillows and found long hairs on both...i was disgusted at the hygeine and would never stay again at this establishment.

"i was in chicago for a convention and stayed at the sheraton towers. i had a negative experience because i got about one dozen very painful bites by bed bugs on my torso. it made attending the conference uncomfortable. the staff changed the sheets but could not move me to another room, as the conference had booked the whole hotel. after the sheets were changed, i got no more bites, thankfully. despite this, i managed to enjoy the stay. i liked the location next to the river, and the fact that it was easy to walk to magnificent mile.

"we had reservations (guaranteed by credit card) for 2 nights this past weekend. when we checked in the clerk told us that they could not accommodate us for both nights because they were overbooked due to a conference in town. i asked them to relocate us for both nights so that we would not have to move in the morning. they sent us over to another location that they assured could accommodate us. the night manager gave us the address to a different hotel and sent us on our way. eventually we arrived at the correct second hotel where the staff were expecting a letter from the sheraton for the transfer - something we were never given. eventually we checked into this second property and the next afternoon when our keys didn't work we found out that the night manager of the sheraton had not assured that we could stay both nights at the second hotel. so once again we had no place to stay despite having a guaranteed reservation with the sheraton. in addition to all of this, we had to pay $24 for parking at the sheraton to find out that they would not accommodate us despite a guaranteed reservation. i am still shocked by this bad experience.

"two main issues: (1) understaffed from the street to the front desk. unfortunately i had to drive into the city, when i arrived there was an excessively long wait for parking. then inside, there was a huge queue line with just one clerk working in a big city hotel. not good (i will say friendly however) (2) i know this is a big city, but, $49 a night to park my car when i'm staying at that hotel? really?? that's unreasonable and a bit gouging in my opinion. again, i realize this is chicago, but, i'm already paying a hefty price for this outdated hotel.

"stayed in april for two nights. i hesitated selecting the sheraton becaue i had a very poor stay there earlier this year. as far as i'm concerned, that's two strikes and i won't give them a chance at # three. doormen wouldn't help on arrival, huge line at c/i, lousy room, malfunctioning remote, unresponsive staff, and incorrect bill. if you want to be close to michigan ave, try the westin or intercontinental and spare yourself the problems. i don't understand why certain places never improve. is it that tough to properly train a staff?
",truth
"i recently stayed at the sheraton for an onsite conference, and had problems from the getgo. i had problems with the check-in even though i had made arrangements beforehand to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file. the front desk clerks were kind of rude. the room was okay, not worth what i paid for. the sheets were kind of messed up and the room didn't feel very clean. they also charge for internet access, which is ridiculous. most hotels provide free wi-fi. the conference food, which i assume is catered by the hotel, was not good at all. on the day of the check out, i had arranged for a late check-out, but in the morning before check-out time, someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in! then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time. all in all, i would recommend staying somewhere else.

"as a frequent traveler for work, i stay at many spg properties. compared to all the spg property in chicago, this is by far the worst. why? 1) they charge you to use the gym. $12 per day or something like $24 for your entire stay. i can't even begin on what a rip off that is. 2) as a gold or platinum member, you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room. they do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one. 3) they do not have wireless internet. it is 2010- enough said. to charge you at least over $200 a night, all the above amenities should be built into that cost. i would never stay here again.

"firtly they took $372 off my card, even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night. they had no business taking the money off of my card. so on the 28th sep i contacted them and they admited to the mistake. it is not a month later and i have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back. secondly i booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel. when i looked a week later, they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate, so two of my friends didn't come to the trip away. thirdly i asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken asap as the dollar was weak against the pound. after about 8 phone calls over 5 months (each saying they would) they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional ps150. overall, the hotel was nice and in a nice location, but i will never be staying there again due to all my problems.

"great bed, but when i first came in, i requested a room with a lake view (i requested this over the phone as well), and the front desk woman said ""this is a great room"". i go upstairs and its awful looking. the view was of the neighboring roofs. then i spent half an hour trying to find a better room. eventually i got a corner roof with a partial view. horrible experience. also rooms were small and had crappy look (yellowy wallpaper and bedsheets)

"generally speaking, nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue. we checked the closed with the mini bar (picture uploaded), so much dust, nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years. we called in housekeeping, giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it. still the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs. later. next day moved to a renovated room, much better but not 5 star clean at all. in addition, there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception, no wonder when just 1/3 of the counters is actually open. please do something about these issues its ruining everything!

"was there recently for one night for a conference. tried to check-in at 5:30pm (the published check-in was 3pm), they said my room wasn't ready, where as others coming after me were assigned rooms. was given a dummy door key card and asked to chill in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready. i chilled there until 8pm, no call, so went out for dinner. came back at 9:30pm and asked if my room was ready. the gal said of course yes and give me a key. when asked why no one called me, she just shrugged. no, my troubles did not end there. i went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room. came back to the lobby, then they apologized and gave me another room. i said i was not going to walk-in on somebody else again, so they sent someone with me to open the new room. for all my ""trouble"" they reduced my bill by about 40%. it was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru. very bad experience.

"we stayed here for one night, and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest. we found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this - @ $200 for the night. we felt when we checked in that if you weren't with the conference, then why were we staying in the hotel. the guy at the main door didn't even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby, we then had to que for 15-20 minutes just to check in. we were not given any information about the hotel and when i rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that i could access the internet through, i was just short of being asked why didn't i bring my lap-top with me so i could use the internet access in the room.... !! i found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist.

"i have traveled to chicago many times for business, and so i have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons. there was nothing dramatically wrong the sheraton, but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel. it almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs. the carpets were old, there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom, towels and linens were older than i expected, the rooms were in need of some redecorating, etc. during the week i was paying $349 per night for a room, and it simply was not near the quality i expected for that price. one positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good. plenty of aerobic machines with tvs, weights, etc. location is also quite good (perhaps the reason for the high price) with close walks to michigan avenue and the river. in summary, i think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown chicago.
",truth
"my wife and i stayed here for a weekend in chicago and had an okay experience. the location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown chicago hotel. everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in chicago means a taxi ride. the other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere. i don't necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby, the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere. the pool/spa/excercise room was not very impressive either. it is accessible by walking through the business center corridor, wondering if you're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small. there is also no hot tub and the ""spa"" is a closet with a massage table. the concierge was helpful but the people that answer the ""sheraton promise"" phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors. the beds were super comfortable. i think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do much better in downtown chicago.

"after staying at the sheraton royal orchid hotel in bangkok, i was expecting a similar experience at the chicago sheraton. i had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience. unfortunately, my expectations were not met. for the past 3 years i stayed at the palmer house in the loop, but thought i'd try a more modern hotel. pros - location by the chicago river, two blocks from michigan avenue - restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment - buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes, crepes and french toast cons - check-in assigned me to a city view room when i had prepaid for a river view room - river view was good, but the windows to see it were filthy - dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door - bathroom was unimpressive: bathtub-shower combination; worn plumbing fixtures; only 2 sets of towels provided - guest room was small: only one soft chair provided - guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway - 7 to 8 block walk to nearest l-station - concierge couldn't explain how to get to the mercury theatre, nor print a map of the area - guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the link cafe - no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room - no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before check-out - not all computers were operational at the link cafe where boarding passes can be printed

"i stayed at the sheraton as it was where a conference i was attending was being held. on the plus side, the hotel is reasonably well located, within a few minutes walk of michigan avenue. my room had a superb view out over the river. however, for the price i must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment. the decor was dated, and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty. the wifi is ridiculously expensive, and frustratingly as a conference delegate i was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access. there was no wifi in the conference rooms, although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails. i know chicago is expensive, but for that price i feel the experience should have been better.

"we travel to chicago frequently and have stayed in many of the hotels downtown. we were excited to try the swissotel, but left disappointed. the actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views, the staff was extremely rude. the man that checked us in was on the phone and did not acknowledge us until he was done with his phone call. he then did not say more than five words, which were ""i need a credit card"". the lobby bar had fireplaces and was very cozy. the hotel information said it closed at 2am so we came back to hotel at 1230am for a ""night cap"", that was last call. that was fine for us, but the bar was full and many people were coming back from their night wanting a ""night cap"" but did not make last call. our night ended listening to many unhappy people complaining and receiving no sympathy from the employees. there are many places to stay in the area that are just as nice or nicer, no need to stay at the swissotel again. definitely don't stay if you're looking for a romantic weekend away, the employees will ruin your experience from the second you walk in the door.

"my wife and i frequently stay downtown for a night in the city. we have been to many hotels in the downtown chicago area. my opinion of the swissotel - spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience. the swissotel has a very 'cold' atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable. the room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average. the view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel. other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more. our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 8:00a which woke us up. we called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk. we also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel. they said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register. he didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment. overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment. spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off michigan avenue for real top notch service. anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area.

"i just had a conference there. they have bed bugs--i have all these bug bites and it itches like hell. food wise, we had chicken both times for lunch (maybe my company was saving some $) but they should at least prepare them differently. it looked like they did the same style chicken but change the underlying ""bed"" upon which it is served. for dinner, we had filet mignon and crab cake. sounds good right? wrong! the filet mignon seems to be 1/2 the thickness of what i have seen and it was tough. i thought the filet mignon is suppose to be tenderest part of the cow???? also, the crab cakes was a bit too salty. finally the portions were tiny and left me lacking. in asking my co-worker, most seem to be blase about the food. however, some seem to like the burger (which they went to substitute) at the palms, which is a restaurant inside the hotel, just off the lobby. on the positive note, the dessert for dinner was good. otherwise, i'd recommend another hotel. in the meantime, when i got home, i make sure to bring everything straight to the washer/dryer to disinfect (even strip down). but, damn, i'm still itchin'

(this was their mistake) they told me i could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived. they did nothing to try and help me until i stood there and complained for twenty minutes. i can't believe that a ""manager"" would treat a customer this way. there are other great hotels in chicago. this hotel is not worth the aggravation!

"swissotel continues to be a *yawn* as previous posters state, punching in your floor is ridiculous. on the other hand, technology wise it could be helpful in routing ppl to different elevators (but if idiots like to cram into one elevator and leave the others free for me, why change)? in any case, i want to take a nice hot soak and--guess what--they are having water problems... sooooo disappointed. hopefully i don't get bug bitten this time (checked under the sheets). sadly, due to my company's deal, i think i have to stay here again next year *sigh*...but so far they are batting 1 star.... -------------- oh boy, it must be my luck...or rather this hotel is just run down. i had to swap room four times. and that's for a thurs nite-sunday morning stay. my first room had no hot water so i had to switch rooms. they gave me the key to the 2nd room, which happened to be occupied. luckily the occupants had their security latch on, so there wasn't any embarrassing moment. my third room was fine for 2 nights but then today (just now) i had to move because of water leakage (above my room and below my room). boy, talk about an awful hotel (or my just awful luck???? maybe it's karma since i wrote a bad review last year, and continue to write one...but it's the truth). oh, also last year may not have been bed bugs. i have checked the room and it looks bug free but i still get these itchy patches on my leg. perhaps it is something in the sheets...or the air/hvac.... in any case, despite the decent staff, it is a one at best (0 for hotel, 1 for the still nice service--since it's not their fault....) all i can say is ...thank goodness my company won""t hold the conference in chicago next year, or at least at this hotel!!!!!!!!

"i stayed at the allegro hotel while interviewing for a position in chicago. i read the reviews and they were mixed, but since the property was suggested by the organization (due to location), i booked a room. true to the reviews, the room was extremely small, was cold (the heater blew in cold air in -2 degree weather), and just generally uncomfortable. there was no closet so i hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room. the bathroom was extremely small and although tidy, not especially clean (it was dusty). the bed (which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full) was quite low and the sheets were hard. because i arrived late, i ordered room service. there was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desk/table sideways. although there is free wireless (a plus), i kept getting kicked out of the system and had to, no lie, reconnect on-line a record 16 times. finally, to top it all off, the television stopped working just a little before midnight. i was only there for one evening (not even 12 hours) but that was enough for me. this is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but i've stayed at better 2 star properties. on the positive side, the staff is nice and friendly, the food is reasonably good, and the lobby is really vibrant. there is a martini bar (although as i was coming in, a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey) that looked interesting. overall though, not the best stay i've had. i won't be staying again.

"this is about the fourth time we stayed at the allegro. the previous times, i have nothing but good to say about the allegro. but my reaction has soured on this place. we have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in december as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping. from the very start, this year was a disappointment. i had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the allegro. i was quoted one price (higher than what was on line), when i mentioned this, i was told i could have the lower price. at check in, the desk was nice but not friendly. we discovered that our room was not as good as in the past (punishment for asking for a lower price?) the closet had no hangers, we had no place to put our suitcase. no one mentioned the wine reception in the evening. on the second day, we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing. it took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one. i wrote the management following our stay. i have yet to receive a reply. needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time. i would advise others to do the same.

"me and my husband stayed in the allegro hotel chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently. we got a room with a king size bed.. although the room is small, we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages & all. however, we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable, the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us. the walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound. 1 of the days, our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels, rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign. the worst is upon returning to the hotel at night, we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage. the housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins. this is unacceptable to us. the hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night. although it is near the cta trains, i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view. am staying again at a kimpton hotel in san fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change! overall, not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to chicago again!

"i'm a frequent business traveler and often in chicago on trips. at times, it's very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown chicago, and this was one of those times. i recently had to pay almost $400 for one night at the allegro. it was absolutely not worth it. the hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers, so check-in and check-out were very slow. there were very few elevators, which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests. the morning i checked out, our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby, but the elevator was almost completely full when i got on at the 18th floor, so i can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs. the room was extremely small and cramped, even though it had obviously been renovated recently. the tv, bed, and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel. still, the rate was way overpriced for such a small room. the best thing about the allegro was the room service, which was prompt. the food was good, and the prices were very reasonable for room service. from now on, if my regular hotels are booked, i'll just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isn't worth it.

"often visit chicago, but this was my first stay at this location. was able to secure a good rate through travelzoo. thought the room was clean and was nicely decorated. was very disappointed in the service. stayed on a saturday night - waited 20 minutes for extra pillows - called for 15 minutes but found out the third shift crew came in 20 minutes late. also received an incorrect folio under my door(another guests that was staying at this location). i called the front dest to inform them of the error - and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected. i opened my credit card statement and found that i was charged for three different rooms - one on the date of my visit and two a week later. i called the hotel and guest services took the information and forwarded to their accounting department. received a message to call the billing department, have called three times - but have not received another reply back.

"we stayed in the amalfi in july 2010, 4th of july weekend. i was very apprehensive about leaving my diesel ford excursion with the valet at amalfi. it has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly. i explained the procedure to the valet drivers, and felt like it was a complete waste of time. when the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as i had instructed. when i tried to start it, it wasn't happy, but did finally start. i was so relieved to get it back i just wanted to leave. driving away i noticed that the top speed recorded on the gps was 105mph!!! (previous top speed was 95mph, done a few days earlier driving across south dakota). i could just picture the flying ferrari scene in ferris bueller's day off. i couldn't imagine where in the crowded chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast, though it wouldn't take long to make that happen (see reference to modified engine above). a little while later we stopped for lunch and i noticed a dent in the front bumper. i contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people. no remedy. lesson learned. brett

"overview: --overrated hotel in a premium location. the great: --location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants, bars, and sights. the good: --inviting lobby, pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby, in particular the night deskman. --nice bathroom, comfortable bed and desk chair. the mediocre: --room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --no kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from harry caray's across the street. --free cocktails 5-7pm in ""lounge"" is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. pressure is pretty low. --view - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. the bad: --free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day, even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. same deal for my iphone. i also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my norton anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --no blackout curtains! i had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). never had this issue in any hotel or motel i've ever stayed at. --noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling, bar music, trucks, car horns, and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. i had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --tv had crappy hd signal with out of sync audio on every channel. and the remote was useless. --in room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of fiji water bedside was insulting. don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. summary: --not recommended. looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. rating on yelp is bloated by at a least a star.

"we stayed at amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more. it's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it's just not worth the money. it does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast. the sheets though, made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things. the breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt. otherwise, it's just an early morning sugar attach of muffins, danishes, sweet breads, and croissants. there are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety, if you are into that sort of thing. also, the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room. the problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time, alternating between cold and warm, right over the bed. there is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale. they do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free. the problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there. one person at a time... all and all, we will not stay there again. if we feel like luxury, we have to find some other place. but if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city, maybe we will try red roof inn or something like that. at least we'll know what we are paying for.

"stayed at the amalfi hotel in chicago this month with good expectations. and what a disappointment! paid just under $200 for a ""deluxe king"", and what we got was a 2nd floor view of construction, a dirty, badly ""rehabbed"" bathroom, itchy sheets, no down comforter!! (just sheets and the gross old hotel blanket thing) , previously opened bottles in our mini bar, and plenty of rude, inexperienced staff members & managers (def. not a 3 or 4 star staffing!!) i do live in chicago, and have stayed at a wide range of places. i know that for $200 in february, you can expect a great hotel. as there were many available the weekend we stayed at amalfi, choosing it over say, the palmer house hilton, hotel sax, sutton place, hotel 71, was a huge waste. definitely keep looking and book elsewhere. not worth the price at all, don't let their pictures fool you. also, i wouldn't say that our experience was just a rare mishap, the hotel looks like an old days inn that had undergone a slight renvation, i.e., new lamps.

(the lobby, by the way, used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit. also no longer...). the food is very bad. very. bad. there are so many restaurants in this city. do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat. its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels: based on my review of everything else. go to the drake, or the peninsula. completely worth the extra money... that, or downgrade to the hilton and get what you expect and pay for... the intercontinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the hilton, but you get a worse experience! its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership: i canceled our membership after this disaster. part of the membership includes early check-in (granted, when available)... but our room wasn't ready until 6pm. this is obviously after normal check-in. the staff was overwhelmed, and not effective or helpful. i tried to speak with the manager about our room, waited in long line to speak with someone, only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name. in a nutshell. go somewhere else. ps: go to argo tea next door instead of the starbucks in the hotel. way better food and coffee.

"after reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel, i went ahead and got an ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness. i normally have a good experience with intercontinental hotels, particularly the mark hopkins in sf. i called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as ambassador club. when i arrived at the hotel, there was no separate check-in line (as advertised) and the manager on duty basically ignored me when i told him i was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room. i was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty. they gave me a room in the ""modern"" tower, (built in the 60's) which was about 2/3 the size of a regular room at the mark hopkins (built in '29). i had to deal with torn sheets, cracked marble sinks, and the spare roll of toilet paper being located outside the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that? the closet door, if you are not careful, may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door. i was not provided with a key to the minibar and i called for turndown service, which never happened. the next day, they finally got around to the fact that i was an ambassador club member and entitled to an upgraded room, but since i travel with a medical device which i already set up in the tiny room, i declined. to their credit, they did send some of the amenities i would otherwise be entitled to as an ambassador club member. i would not stay at this hotel next time i go to chicago. there are other better places for the money including, the omni, the james, the fairmont, hyatt, sheraton, monaco, crowne plaza, even the holiday inn and marriotts located in the same general area.

"to start with, this hotel had the worst customer service. they were impossible to work with on everything! now, the problems we had in chronological order. first, we arrive at 8 pm sat. to check in. they did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available, so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway (free of charge). however, the room was not ready yet. finally at 10.30! (2.5 hrs later) we were able to get our room keys. but, there was no rollaway. another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later, we had a rollaway, but had to get the charge waived a second time. now we go to check out on mon. and they couldn't print us a bill or give us a total. we stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn $2,127.00! we called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 times, for $709 each, when our bill was supposed to be $450. after sitting at the gas station on the phone for 1.5hrs, the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home. i would recommend a holiday inn over the intercontinental any day.

"spent three nights in chicago at this property. first of all, i have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the magnificent mile close to terrific restaurants, the art institute and orchestra hall. the hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new wing. the rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired. this property needs to be renovated. some observations: the junior suite i had was laid out strangely. a small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom. the mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right - made shaving a challenge and messy. while descending in the elevator one morning, it started shaking so violently that i could barely stand up. it stopped on the 11th floor and i was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down. (this experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up - an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness!) reports from my group were of sinks stopped up, exposed bolts in rooms, and generally things not working. now the good news - the staff is terrific. they make you feel welcome, are personable, have their own personalities, great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help. i wish they had a better property to work in.

"not impressed at all. the hotel itself looks really nice, especially in the big foyer area. our room was small, and the bathroom needed some major upgrades. it had the green tile, like at your grandmother's house, all over the walls, and 2 people couldn't fit in it if you tried. we could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning, so obvioulsy the walls aren't so thick. our room looked directly on to a brick building outside, very close, we couldn't even tell if it was nice outside or not. we are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it, and i felt yucky the whole time in it. i just wouldn't pay lots of money to stay here, there is nothing exceptional about it at all.

"the hotel is excellently situated for visiting the art institute or millennium park. it is an ""old classic"" of a hotel, and the main lobby is a must see, but i would not stay there again. the problem with any hotel dating from long ago (the current one was built in 1923-25) is that, even with extensive remodeling (which was done in 2007-2009) it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today (in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much). we had a reasonably sized room (king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair) but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries. also, there was no coffee machine in the room - something i have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days. my major complaint about this stay was the executive lounge. it is usually worth while to pay the extra for access - in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors d'oeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price. (since we are currently at the diamond level in the hilton honors program, we get access for free at the hiltons but i usually upgrade at other chains such as the hyatt.) at the palmer executive lounge i ordered a couple of glasses of wine (there was a bartender on duty) and was slightly surprised by the cost - $9/glass which came to $21.44 for two with tax and tip - and was even more surprised by the wine. it was about the worst wine i had tasted in many years. i didn't think it was even as good as trader joe's cheapest $2.99 wine that i tried a couple of weeks ago. unfortunately i didn't get a look at the bottle to see what it was (although i did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard). i noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in - and i can understand iot at the prices they were charging. it then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time. i checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass - the same three varietals as at the bar. the cabernet was a william hill at $10.50/glass from room service. i presume that what i had had at some time been a william hill that had been left to turn to vinegar. it was slightly more expensive from room service, but i hope that it was in a lot better condition.

"i stayed in this hotel for 5 days in november together with my colleagues. internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day. no fridge or microwave included in the price. our room had two too soft full size beds. in the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall. who doesnt believe it, check out the 16th floor close to room 212. with discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous. i stayed in the hyatt regency before for much cheaper and that was way better. the restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty, but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served. please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby.

"will not stay here again. we were here pre-construction so didn't have the noise problems that others are now experiencing. but room and service quality were so poor that we will not return. our suite was large enough, but it was dirty, dated and worn. the bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly. public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days, disgusting. we (politely) requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed. we had paid for the king tut package, which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit. they had no record of this and didn't honor it. of course, the exhibit was sold out, so our main reason for visiting chicago was ruined as we weren't able to see this part of the field museum. my (also polite) letter to hilton and the manager was never acknowledged. very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding hilton in general when possible.

"here are my experiences: - had three rooms reserved, when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms - screwed up initial room assignments, gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in - could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty (we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys) - in room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th - could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th - when we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room. - when we received our bills, the credit card assignments were still wrong. i stay at ""economy"" hotels a lot and i have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one. this hotel should do chicago a service and just close its doors. due to this experience, i will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad.

"i recently stayed at the hotel monaco and i must say, it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city. in the past, i've always stayed at the marriott or the hilton so this time i thought i'd go with a boutique hotel. i've stayed at some of the kimpton properties in san francisco so i was delighted that they are running the monaco. basically, i like the friendly, real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places i've used before. i do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill i normally use. south water kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants. i really dug the complimentary coffee, high speed internet and newspaper. i get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the monaco offered a bunch of freebies -- especially liked the afternoon wine service. all in all, i will return to the monaco. it's a great alternative.

"the atmosphere at the talbott hotel is very welcoming when you first walk in. the employees are friendly and will greet you when you first arrive. the hotel seems to be luxurious, even from the lobby, and right away, i was very excited for my stay! i stayed in a double queen room with my friend. the room is spacious enough, and beds are very comfortable. i didn't try the room service, but they do have a fitness club close by with a spa, which is very convenient. i also love how the room has individual climate controls! very neat! also handy that there is an ihome in the room. i'm usually stuck using just a regular alarm clock radio at other hotels. i will most likely stay in this hotel another time. it was a wonderful experience!

"at first my husband and i were really excited for our family to enjoy the t-rex experience package. we figured it would be a great deal package even though the hotel itself felt too ""ritzy"" for us to travel with our four children. but after two nights of downtown chicago fun we realized that the talbott transcends it's ritzy look and truly embraces a family friendliness which we thoroughly enjoyed.

"the rates at the talbott hotel were cheaper than i had expected, and that was my reason for booking a room. i had been prepared for service and a room similar to what i had experienced in the past, and i was quite pleased when i did stay. the room was neat and clean, and the halls were quiet at night. the traffic noise was muffled to the point where it was no problem sleeping either. i did ask one question at the service desk and they answered it nicely, which is good because normally hotel workers can be a bit snippy, especially at night. overall i had no problems with the talbott hotel and i would stay at this here again if i were in the area a second time.

"i enjoyed my stay at the talbott hotel. it is on the more expensive side, but it is all worth it. i got the talbott tradition package, which was $245 for two people and included a $30 breakfast credit on check out day. the rooms are huge! the beds are soft and comfortable. they include aveda bath products, which is a plus in my book. they also have a nice fitness area & pool you can use while you stay there. one thing i thought was really cool is that you can forward your messages from your hotel room phone to your cell phone. my boyfriend also liked the ihome audio system. the location of this hotel is very convenient as well, its close to several great restaurants and blocks from the coast. but, what i like best about this hotel is that they make an honest effort to not negatively impact the environment more than they need to. they were one of the first hotels to be green sealed. overall i had a great stay at talbott hotel!

"my stay at this hotel was one of the best i have ever had! the location, service and accommodations were all outstanding!! the lobby area is beautiful as was my room. in the room there was more than enough space, which is difficult to find in chicago hotels. my only gripe was the room was a little dark. sure, staying at a small, upper-class hotel like the talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it. the service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed. the room service took a bit longer than i would have liked, however, the food was good quality. another nice touch was the gym pass provided for guests at the equinox fitness center. finally, the location is perfect!! it's located in a beautiful area of the city near the gold coast, which has many very good restaurants. a personal favorite of mine is mario's, a nice italian place nearby. overall, my experience at the hotel was good and while it had some minor flaws they were, for the most part, insignificant.

"my visit to the conrad chicago in the heart of downtown was a luxurious experience bar none. the lobby is immaculate and is filled with reams of class and style. the rooms are beautifully adorned. i especially like the flat screen tv and wired internet. i'm never happy with wireless connections so it is nice to find a hotel that knows that its guests need fast, reliable internet connectivity, and it's included at no additional charge. the view from the room was magnificent...downtown chicago at night! the restaurant is spectacular but the terrace is the place to be when weather permits. you cannot get a more breathtaking view and be able to relax in the gentle breeze of evening while dining on the finest gourmet foods. don't forget to visit the health and fitness center with their selection of aerobic and anaerobic workout equipment. the staff is attentive to your every need and the concierges can get you whatever you need. just ask! this is the place to stay in chicago if you want to be pampered in luxury!

"we recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park while travelling for business. what an incredible experience! friends had stayed there years ago, but when we showed them our photos, they couldn't believe the amazing renovations. while we loved the modern decor and style, our main reason for choosing this hotel was because of what they call fairmont pure rooms. i have had so many awful allergy attacks while travelling, so i wasn't too optimistic that they could actually make a truly hypoallergenic and allergy-free room. i have to say i felt great during our entire stay. we enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine and incredible cheese and appetizers at eno. what a treat to get such amazing food and wine without even having to walk out of the hotel. this hotel is truly beautiful, everything you would expect from a high-end, big city hotel. our stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park didn't disappoint us in any respect. our only disappointment? we don't have a reason to go back to chicago anytime soon, but i have a feeling we will be making reservations for another visit in the very near future.

"quite simply the hyatt regency chicago is the business traveler's best friend. recently i had to attend a seminar in chicago and stayed at the hyatt. to say i was impressed would be an understatement. centrally located in the heart of downtown, the hyatt has perfected the art of ultimate guest satisfaction. on arrival the staff goes into overdrive. they make you feel like you are the only guest in this huge hotel. the rooms are very big and elegantly furnished with 100 percent cotton linens. my room came equipped with flat screen tv, wi-fi and high speed internet. room service was quite extensive and if it was not on the menu they went out of their way to accomodate you. there were also car rental on site as were restaurants, cocktail bar and a 24 hour dining room. they have state of the art conference rooms with high tech features. there is also catering and limo service. the staff is multilingual and the concierge service is very professional. all in all they will pamper you from head to toe and other parts in between. this hotel is definitely worth the price and i will definitely return not as a business traveler but as a tourist who wants to be pampered. my only regret? that i could not stay much longer.

"i never thought i'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home. i am a mother of two children, one of which has severe asthma and allergies. i have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years. so when my sister was getting married in chicago, i was extremely anxious. the front desk associate, rosa, was wonderful. she told me that they have allergy friendly rooms. no perfumes, no harsh cleaning chemicals, no dreaded ""industry standard"" feather pillows. i booked a room, but was still really worried. i shouldn't have been. ethan breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home. maybe even a little better. they had an air purification system for our room. it smelled so fresh! while my husband took our daughter to the big bar for nachos (she never stopped talking about how ""totally cool"" it was), i ordered room service for my son. the man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating. my son has a lot of food allergies, so i was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details. that's always a little humbling, but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time. i was actually able to enjoy my sister's wedding. the only problem with my stay is that it was too short. we're coming back for our first family vacation since ethan was born. thank you, hyatt regency chicago, for making this family's visit possible and positive!!

"i have to admit, i was a little leery about visiting chicago due to my mild agoraphobia, but after a family member reserved a room at the hotel allegro chicago, my fears were slightly assuaged. a few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before, and had nothing but positive things to say. with this new-found optimism in mind, i went forward on my journey in confidence. i have to say, i was not let down. from the moment i stepped into the lobby, i felt at home. the concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms, and the check-in process was fast and efficient. the rooms themselves are incredibly homey, feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire's mansion. the high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels, really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in chicago, and provided a secure place to stay at night, or whenever i did not feel like participating with the group. of course, the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel. i found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building. overall it's very cozy, and has a certain old-world feeling to it, once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times. it was never overwhelmingly crowded, and the people i did encounter were incredibly friendly, yet not intrusive. i don't usually enjoy staying in hotels, but i love the allegro chicago!

"last weekend my wife and i decided to take a weekend trip to chicago. when looking for a hotel we weren't all that interested in price, but more of a relaxing getaway in the heart of downtown. i did some research and and came across the amalfi hotel chicago. what sparked my interest was it's location and the fact that they offer in room spa treatments. located in chicago's river north area, it is close to the magnificent mile so we can get all of our shopping done while staying relatively close to the hotel and also do some sightseeing along the chicago river on one of many chicago boat tours, both of which were fantastic! after a long day out on the town we came back to the hotel to induldge in their in room spa treatments. my wife got the whole works (facial, manicure and pedicure, and hot stone massage therapy), while i enjoyed a deep tissue massage to get rid of some of the pain from walking around all day! for dinner we went downstairs and enjoyed a fabulous dinner at harry caray's italian steakhouse. best steak i've ever had, hands down. when we were finished with dinner we just wanted to go back to our room and relax so we hopped into our comfortable king size bed, put in a movie with their in room dvd players and beautiful 32 inch hdtv's. for anyone looking for a nice relaxing getaway to the great city of chicago, i would recommend the amalfi hotel chicago to anyone. they offer anything you could ever want in a luxury hotel plus more.

"i recently stayed at the amalfi chicago with my wife on a business trip. we decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded. we enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city. the individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service. the amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more. our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site. the hotel's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses. lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable. breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt. being of european descent, i enjoyed the croissants, whole grain muffins, real butter and marmalade. we also brought along our standard poodle, sterling, and the amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family. we purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings. sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling ""at home"" while away. for pet lovers this is a big plus. finally, transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal. this allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this, another appreciated bonus of our stay. thank you amalfi for a superb experience.

"having stayed in standard hotels before, when my wife suggested we stay in an upscale hotel for our weekend in chicago i was skeptical to say the least. after staying at the amalfi hotel i may never stay in a regular motel again! right off the bat instead of a 40 foot counter with snooty workers or kids that started two days ago they have individual desks for check in with people that *gasp* have a clue as to what they are doing. we got the steakhouse package deal at the on-site keefer's steakhouse restaurant the food was the highest quality and cooked to perfection. the room was spacious had robes and slippers, a stocked mini-bar, the mattress was comfy, and the whole room was clean. the staff was amazing and had no problems bringing extra towels and pillows for my wife. in the morning the continental breakfast was served on each floor instead of herding into the lobby which i loved cause i love breakfast but not crowds. unfortunately for me the hotel was close to a lot of shopping, my wife was in heaven however, and we spent a large portion of the day on the magnificent mile attempting to max out my credit cards. the whole trip i believe was made special by the atmosphere of the hotel and its staff i would recommend the amalfi to anyone visiting chicago.

"at the intercontinental chicago, you pay for more than a room. you pay for an experience. let me elaborate. i was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. like any novice traveller to chicago, i saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs, and those were originally what i set my sights on. price is a powerful signal, and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. but after doing a bit of research, i realised that distance does have its costs. the price of transit in the chicagoland area isn't free. and it's far from what i'm used to. car use is price prohibitive. (i knew that originally, which is why i wasn't going to drive.) but the sting of using the automobile (parking, congestion, toll roads, etc.) gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. so, i ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. but mass transit has its costs too, which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. that's what originally drew me to intercontinental. but intercontinental is much more than the right room at the right place. the decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. i was travelling on international business, so the ease with which i could transact in foreign currency was a draw. (they had a currency exchange right there on the premises.) and the fact that massages, dry cleaning, and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. my work gets me tied up in knots. it also leaves little time for doing chores. so the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. but, on top of all that, the event planning was what put intercontinental over the top. being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something i won't forget. in the end, if you're a newcomer to chicago staying in a time-crunch, the intercontinental is for you. the pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive, but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs, it's nothing in the end. and the intercontinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options, it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be.

"i stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the chicago bears fan convention (feb 27- march 1). the hotel is beautiful. i had a towers room. i had a decent view of the city (sears tower). the room was a little small but had two bathrooms (1 king bed). the tower room has it's own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast, evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day. the registration/ lounge is on the 24th floor and overlooks lake michigan. the hotel was full but service was excellent. the location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two (especially toward the el train). we loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car. i will stay here again. hilton offered a sunday night free on their website with a 3 day stay. this made the cost reasonable (for chicago). however, the pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired. the pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink.

"my stay was quick but awesome. after a long day, seeing a substantial line at check-in was a bit of a groaner, but then i saw the self-serve kiosks. i was checked in with keys in hand in under 3 minutes. in the morning i was able to check out on the tv in my room. the hotel is a beautiful historic landmark with all the amenities of a modern hotel and all the charm of its 1927 origins. the bed was fabulously comfortable. i wish i could live there. they have many rooms wtih 2 bathrooms. i stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we didn't know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms. talk about squeals of delight. that was about 7 years ago in virginia beach. i was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms, but it's the first time i've seen this since. what a great feature!

"stayed at the chicago hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door i was very impressed. check-in was quick, easy and i was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time. we were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant. it made getting ready to go out much quicker! the hotel location is great opposite the park, which is a must see. although located on south michigan ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of michigan ave. would also recommend the street one block back from michigan ave for good shopping. for breakfast i would recommend grabbing a muffin, croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant. for evening entertainment kitty o'sheas is a must. typical irish bar with good drinks and live music. finally the bed at hilton chicago is the most comfortable bed ever. i would have taken it home if i could! definately made for a good nights sleep.

(we have stayed here before and always end up eating here.) there are a lot of attractions within a mile including the field museum, shedd aquarium, soldier field, and navy pier. they may not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window. overall, we had another wonderful stay at the chicago hilton. (our 4th stay) the only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel.....41 dollars a night is kind of ridiculous.

"my stay at the the james was perfect. my room was thoughtfully designed: the lighting, the storage space, the bar area, the eating nook and everything else in the room was purposeful and pretty to look at. the staff was friendly and and genuinely accomadating. the restaurant (primehouse) echoed the above. great service and one of the best steaks i've had in a very long time.

"we needed an extra night in chicago after a gratus stay at the penninsula and won a skyauction bid for the james @ $203. this is one of the nicest hotels that i've ever stayed in. bathroom aside, we felt it equalled the penninsula in comfort and level of service. i echo all of the superlatives previously written and would love to stay here anytime i'm in town.

"my wife and i stayed at the james recently and we had a great experience. the hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. it's in a quiet location, yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. we upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. it didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have, but it was elegantly appointed, spacious, and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. the service was amazing. everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable. this was true from the doormen at the front, to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. both concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions, and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. the breakfast at prime downstairs is among the best i have ever had in a hotel, this goes for the room service as well. dinner there was good, but not great. i mentioned almost flawless, as there was a situation that occurred involving the spa in the hotel. it involved scheduling and was aggravating, as the hotel actively encourages its use. however, caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied, following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. the experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. overall, we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits. 
",truth
"we have just returned from a week at the james chicago. the hotel is fabulous, very chic and chilled. the service is beyond compare. check in and out were swift and painless. the concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay. the hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in chicago - voted by chicago residents. we stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city. the room (a deluxe king) was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies, hairdryer, safe, tv, robes & slippers, a very interesting selection of minibar items (one of which was a real surprise!) including crisps/snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella! we also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with kiehls products and a cosy little dining area. the ipod dock/cd/radio and complimentary chillout cd were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv. the super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary wifi allowed us to plan our next day's activities from our bedroom. we were so busy touring around the city we didn't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab. the bar/lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more. staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available. the barman mixes a mean mohito ! this hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e.g. the virtual tuck in service - basically a couple of pcs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they're away from home on business. also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends. next visit to chicago i'll definitely be staying here and wouldn't even consider an alternative if the james can maintain these standards. 
",truth
"took a weekend trip with my wife. got a great rate with valet included, paid a couple extra bucks for the larger room. staff was nice, workout facility was great. room has current decor, but was starting to show some wear. watch the concierge, she suggested a pretty bad restaurant to us. 
",truth
"my significant other and i recently spent 3 nights at the james and on the last day i said, ""i wish we could stay longer"". that good! the room was immaculate and a very pleasant surprise from the moment you open the door. everything is high tech. plasma tv, cd/radio, projection alarm clock (love that so much bought one today). if you wanted room service you got it from david burke and the mini bar and liquor selection was plentiful. they even have a four legged friend menu. the bathroom was pleasant with bathrobes/slippers and upscale products provided. the bed was the best in a hotel ever. linens were crip, white and fresh. maid service twice daily with turn down service. safe in room, ice delivered, iron, hairdryer all top of the line. the filtered window shades blacked out the light and matched the modern decor. mid-century style with funky chair/ottman, cubes and a table with nightstands gave us plenty of room and felt like comforts of home. the staff was courteous and accommodating. the library, free internet access, in room wifi were extras we didn't expect . bar/lounge areas seems to be frequented by locals enjoying cocktails and appetizers in the lobby. funky artwork. location, location, location. the best place we've ever stayed not only in chicago. highly recommend. 
",truth
"i believe i can not describe how amazing was our stay at the james. service was impecable, from the door man to the front desk. location could not be better. yes, you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor, but, come on, you are downtown, what do you expect....overall noise was not in a level to bother us. the only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm...pm not am? go figure... 
",truth
"my husband and i wanted to spend the weekend in chicago to celebrate our anniversary, and i had been looking at the james for awhile because it was attached to david burke's primehouse. from the moment i called to make my reservation, i knew this hotel understood what customer service means to a consumer and a picky one at that. from the pre-arrival dossier, to the special sweets from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note thanking us for staying at the james, this staff is well versed in the long lost art of customer service. the rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend. the walking distance to michigan av is a huge plus. from the front desk to the cleaning staff, the staff here is top notch! and david burke's primehouse is not to be missed! 
",truth
"i loved this hotel. the room was so chic and trendy, the bed was comfortable, great slippers and robes. i love the keihl's bath products in the bathroom. we went during my birthday weekend, and they had a card and plate with pastries waiting in the room. we got a great deal on a junior suite from travelzoo, but when we tried to take another trip to chicago, the deal was gone. i really recommend the hotel. i loved it. the only problem we had was with the david burke steakhouse. the service was horrible, they switched our order with the table next to our's and the only compensation was they took off a $7 side dish we ordered (and they were nice enough to not charge us for the other side dish we didn't get). don't go there. go to the lawry's accross the street. but stay at the james. (btw- its not a 3-star hotel like the website lists- its at least 4-star) 
",truth
"the james hotel met and exceeded our expectations. a haven of cool, uncluttered comfort in a hot, crowded but congenial city. located within steps of some of the greatest art, architecture, culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in north america, the staff of the james provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited. the check-in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm, restorative oasis. it is difficult to over-praise the friendly, attentive staff; this is a hotel that truly has its act together! the day before our visit ended, we experienced problems with the room's air conditioner. when the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem, we were immediately upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the chicago skyline. we eagerly await the opening of new james hotels in other cities. 
",truth
"i stayed at the james in june, and i must say, it felt like i was in some ultra-swanky boutqiue hotel. from the uniforms of the staff.. which consists of a small j pin that they wear with nice suits and such, to the wonderful, comfortable beds, the james just makes you feel ultra-relaxed. the gym in the hotel was fantastic for a hotel gym, and the machines were all new and in fantastic condition. i really enjoyed the complimentary kiehl's products as well as the soft, cushy beds with futons. location-wise, it's just off michigan ave, and it's close to all the shops and restaurants. i'd definitely stay here if i'm' ever back in chicago. 
",truth
"stayed for 2 nights at the james, wonderful location 2 mins walk to michigan avenue with all the shops. staff here were all incredibly helpful and genuinely friendly. nothing was too much trouble. rooms are huge and the beds the most comfortable i have slept in. room was very clean, had separate seating area with sofa and chairs with a 42in flat screen tv. there was a bar area with stereo, mini bar and coffee maker. there was another flat screen tv in the bedroom area. bathroom very good with complimentary shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. hotel is also ""pet friendly"". there was even a large bowl of iced water and a barrel of dog biscuits at the front door of the hotel !!!. pets even had their own options on the room sevice menu. 
",truth
"i have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and i can honestly stay that the james is tops. the service at the hotel is first class. the rooms are modern and very comfortable. the location is perfect within walking distance to all of the great sights and restaurants. highly recommend to both business travellers and couples. 
",truth
"just returned to seattle after a visit home to chicago and i loved the james!!! recently stayed at the ritz at water tower and the dana around the corner--both of which were great but the james was perfect. secured the room through a package w/ american express for a great deal so though the view wasn't great the space, decor and location can't be beat. staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the gym was substantial and though i didn't try the restaurants/room service, the menus looked yummy. i've stayed in chgo in that area on avg 1-2s/mo over the past three years and the james is at the top my list now. if you can get a good deal, i highly recommend!! 
",truth
"the thing that makes this such an enjoyable place to stay is the staff who were all excellent and polite and the service was impeccable. the room was very clean, the beds were comfortable but it was a little small and the water in the bathroom was not very hot. other than that it was a great place to stay. 
",truth
"i try to stay at the james every time i happen to be in chicago. there are other good choices in town, but nobody has what the james offers: superior service - aka class meets efficiency -, metropolitan design and comfort with an attention to details i found only at the w in seoul, and what always plays a role meaning a convenient location ... then they get to you with small unexpected touches that make the difference ie: i was about to take off and drive north, it was a hot july day...one of the staff members handed me a bottle of water. a small gesture. unexpected and appreciated. the management and the staff understand what we expect and more importantly, what we need. and they consistenly execute against that. 
",truth
"this is a great hotel! from the doorman who greeted us as we arrived, to the young man at the reservation desk to the young woman serving complimentarily wine, everyone was very friendly and helpful. we were ""strangers but for a minute!"" the room was extremely clean, well appointed and we had a pretty view of the chicago river, especially enjoyed from the large window seats. loved the purple polka-dot paper on the toilet paper roll! hallways were large and quiet. the restaurant next door, south water kitchen is very nice too. the location is in walking distance of the theatres, parks, the river (take a cruise), michigan ave. it's ideal. the only negative is that the concierges were not nearly as friendly or inviting as the rest of the staff nor were they very helpful. for a self-sufficient traveler, you wouldn't really need their services (although it is nice) but for someone coming to chicago for the first time, a concierge can be very helpful. i would definately stay at this hotel again and would recommend it. 
",truth
"hotel monaco is in a really great location, only a block away from the miracle mile and a couple of blocks from millenium park. sears tower is also well within walking distance and if you don't mind walking you won't have a problem walking to greek town and lincoln park (we did). the daily, complimentary, wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out. if you can, leave your car behind, you won't need it and the parking is quite pricey, which is not very surprising considering the location. everything was clean, fresh and modern and the staff very helpful. the only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around ""the loop"" was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid's supply room so it was quite busy in the morning. 
",truth
"i can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned. we stayed in room 1112, king with river view. no noise and very comfortable.the price was a bargain at $191 a night. i would stay here again. the ""l"" from midway airport lets you off about two blocks from the hotel. it's a $2 ride - no need for a $40 taxi ride. 
",truth
"this was my first time in chicago and wanted a hotel that was in a good location. this definitely fit the bill. i could walk to all the places i wanted to see - very close to michigan ave and the magnificent mile. about a 15 minute walk to the art institute. the hotel staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. there was coffee in the lobby every morning, that was very welcome. the room was comfortable and clean and fairly quiet. i could hear the train and some traffic from the street (considering the location, this wasn't bad and didn't affect my ability to sleep or relax). i would definitely recommend this hotel - a gem!! 
",truth
"my initial thought of the hotel was, this place is just ok, i didnt look up any reviews as i was staying there with 2 other friends. i was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room. views were good, its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located. i'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is huge. i love all the space they have. flat tv, traditional seating and i admired the fabric-based headboards. those are very nice! walking distance to restaurants were convenient. i'm a highly frequent traveler to chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives. in any event, i'd recommend staying at the monaco again! 
",truth
"we wanted a nice place to stay the night after dinner, theater, and my daughter's 21st birthday. this place certainly fit the bill. it was convenient to everything including the southshore railroad station. the staff were all friendly. their was a small wine reception in the lobby in the evening and starbucks coffee in the morning. ryan, the concierge, ordered flowers for my daughter and had a nice bowl of hershey kisses waiting for us when we arrived. we were upgraded to a suite and although they forgot to make up the sofa bed, they came promptly to get it set up when we called later. the window seats were beautiful as well and i enjoyed drinking my coffee in the morning and reading a book.

"having had a great stay at the monaco last fall with friends, i was disappointed (initially) to arrive on saturday with husband and find that they didn't have our quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for sat. eve. but they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following: found us a nice room at the neighboring swissotel and paid for it! gave us cab fare to get the 4 blocks over there. paid for our valet parking $33 that eve. so naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for sunday eve (when they did have room), we said yes. when we returned, they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our $139 quikbook rate! now that's what i call a recovery!!

"we had a king deluxe room for 2 nights. we reserved the room through the hotel website with aaa discount. we paid $180/nt. we enjoy boutique hotels, as they have so much more personality and personal service. this hotel was no exception. every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful. the room was clean, well decorated, spacious and quiet. we were offered at check-in a room with a view, but warned it was across from the elevator, so we decided to take the quiet, large room with no view. the location of the hotel was perfect for us, we saw wicked while in chicago and had no problem walking to the theater. we also walked the magnificient mile and found the location perfect (we like to walk). we had drinks at the hotel restaurant both nights which was a pleasurable experience. we ate room service for breakfast each morning, and the food was good and the portions were quite large. we would definitely stay here again.

"after reading the reviews on this hotel, i decided to book my stay for july 4th weekend here and i am glad i did, this hotel is absolutely beautiful. our suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows. i do have 1 complaint. the bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great, but other than that i loved it. i would definitely stay there again.

"stayed here with friends for a long weekend in august and loved the hotel. enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour, and the accomodations were quite nice (our beds were very soft and comfortable). we had excellent views of the river from our rooms. the location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town, with easy access to public transportation nearby. my friends actually received the goldfish upon request, which they enjoyed. some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above, but it was minimal. price seemed very resonable to us for the location. will certainly return to the windy city and plan on staying here again.

"our room was on the third floor so there was some street noise - but it certainly didn't spoil our 4 nights in this lovely hotel. wine tasting evening went down extremely well after a day seeing the sights of the city!! our goldish was called oliver - nobody could believe we had our very own goldfish in our room!! all the staff were really helpful and welcoming, making our stay here very relaxing and comfortable. would certainly recommend this hotel.

"after reading so many great reviews i booked the hotel monaco and was not disappointed. i booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens. the location was perfect - right by the river near michigan ave. - minutes walk to the el, millenium park, the theater district and shopping. the room was clean, a little larger than standard and nicely decorated. we had window seats in the room with a view of the river. there was starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening. to top it off, the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area.

"i want to recognize so many people who were exemplary in their service. 1) sylvia rollins, head concierge. i wanted a fairly last minute reservation at mk restaurant. i spoke with sylvia on the phone just a few days prior to arrival and within 15 minutes had the desired reservation. 2) ryan lettier, concierge, provided us detailed information on the architectural cruises. our morning cruise ended up being cancelled by the tour operator and ryan provided a late check out time to cover us until we could get back to the monaco. 3) turndown service was provided as requested and housekeeping in general seemed to be at a high standard 4) even the bellman went out of their way to ask if we knew how to get the train etc when leaving the hotel. the rooms are tastfully furnished in that whimiscal hotel monaco feel. beds and bedding both very comfortable. the complimentary happy hour and morning coffee/tea service were both very utililzed by the hotel guests.

"we loved this hotel and would definitely come back. initially we weren't given a goldfish, which was disappointing, but then we left a tip for the housekeeper, and she rewarded us with one. we had fun sipping wine and playing wii in the lobby every afternoon. the staff were quite friendly and helpful, even printing our boarding passes for us. our room was very comfortable, with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. at first we were worried about noise, since our room was next to the elevator, but we hardly heard it, and didn't notice any street noise either. the hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated, well-lit, and ideally located.

"mostly great with a few islands of relatively minor problems. first the good: outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland, as befitted the season. the restaurant service was absolutely flawless ( servers who don't write orders because they are expected to remember them, remember clients clearly from one day to the other, and go above and beyond consistently). rooms are comfortable: yes the beds are great! the gym is well equipped. second the slightly off putting: mmmhh...we got the ""i love chocolate package"" which advertized: bfast every day, dinner once, snack once and...a gift. and we have an a-club favorite guest membership, which also advertized "" a gift"". so, no gift...either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership. upon enquiry, ""the snack was the gift"". not at all what the package suggested. that said, bfast was sublime and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well. some problems at checkout though: we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but seemingly less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem. would absolutely go back, but probably not on a special package.

"stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for 3 nights in early april 2007. very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the golden mile. good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice french twist. dinner at the restaurant was also good. prices are reasonable. room is comfortable, only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. would definitely stay here again if visiting chicago. concierge recommended a small van tour, which was excellent. however early april is too early to visit chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of chicago was not operating yet.

"i read the reviews on trip advisor for this property which had it ranked as #1 in chicago. i got a king room overlooking michigan ave. the view was beautiful. the room was also impeccable. nice and bright, very fresh and modern. i find it very hard to fault any sofitel's. the service, attentiveness of staff, cleanliness and luxury are always top notch. location was great, head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafe's and restaurants. straight ahead of the hotel on michigan ave is a shoppers paradise. a great place to stay, and much better value than park hyatt. i do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy, such as for the internet. when you are paying top dollar, a few inclusions would be nice.

"sometimes you just can't find fault with a hotel, even if you tried. such was the case with sofitel, where we'd never stayed before. it's a sleek, modern, sophisticated hotel with european touches. we spent three days there on a leisure weekend, we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the hancock building, at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $165 a night. the room was average sized, well-appointed, everything in it worked, and it had a fabulous view of the chicago high-rise jungle, including snippets of the lake. the public areas were wonderfully decorated. the restaurant served a good breakfast at, for chicago, reasonable prices. the staff was excellent. my wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches. the staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her.

"beautifully appointed, professionally staffed, comfortable, well-located, and elegant, with wireless internet access (plus free access in an alcove on the second floor), fitness center (a little small but fine if you use it at the right time), good energy clientele, easy access to michigan avenue, next door to 24-hour restaurant, 2 blocks from 2 starbucks, elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button - they thought of everything. will definitely return!

"i was completely blown away by this hotel. it was magnificent. i got a great deal and i am so happy that i stayed here. before arriving i was nervous as i had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay, for example very noisy. however, whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant, it made no difference to me. my room was huge, bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure, bed was perfect and the view was amazing. hotel is so close to the great shops of magnificent mile, plus a comfortable walking distance to hancock tower and millennium park.

"we've just returned from a two night stay at the affinia chicago and our visit was delightful. thanks to tripadvisor reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the facade and entrance..it was a mess. and the hotel restaurant and bar remain incomplete and unavailable. even parts of the lobby had ""wet paint"" stickers. all these things could have made for a disappointing stay. not so!! although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff. after just a few minutes we felt like we were ""at home."" the suite on the 25th floor, with a fab view along a wall of windows, was sparkling fresh and clean. the bathroom lighting was outstanding and led to my bride of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look younger...she was right! everything in and about the room was ""like-new"" and very stylish. as a visitor we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the magnificient mile and all of its ambiance. thanks to a dedicated and gracious staff, a fantastic location, and chic decorating elements, this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in chicago. the stay was short..but sweet.

"excellent location, feels like a boutique hotel. right next to neiman marcus (v.expensive dept store) and 2 mins walk to john hancock tower. as most american ,medium to high end, hotels service was excellent from the bellhop to reception. upgrade to a suite if you are staying longer than a couple of days as walking around the windy city can be tiring and a suite feels like a small apartment. the pub in the basement is good for a sandwich and a beer. they will be refurbing so take adavantage of lower rates now as i feel they will be going for very high end clients after the remodelling

"i travel a lot for business and quite frankly, my expectations were starting to reach new lows. i usually always choose w hotels just for the consistency (of average hotels). the affinia in chicago has raised my expectations and w hotels are going to suffer in comparison. this hotel is one of the cleanest i have stayed at in some time. service was impeccable. friendly front-desk staff and the extra towels i ordered arrived literally within minutes. the gym has new equipment with plenty of space. and such a fun vibe - without dark hallways and loud music. i have to thank the other reviewers - their reviews led me to the affinia and i was so pleased. my new ""chicago hotel"". it will even lead me to try the manhattan hotels.

"we visited for my 40th birthday. we had never been to chicago so was not sure where to stay. found the deal on this hotel from travelzoo. great rate, staff was awesome, very helpful and nice, location was great. enjoyed our stay but still like nyc better. great, great hotel. would stay again. 
",truth
"as others have said, once all the construction works are completed i suspect that the prices this hotel can (legitimately) charge will put it out of our price range. which will be a pity because it is an excellent hotel, & the location couldn't be better. the room was very spacious, with separate sitting & study areas & a nice bathroom. only 3 minor points: downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast (coffee & pastries), but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this; the cost of internet - $9.99 - is a bit dear especially when lots of motels now offer it free; there was only powered milk in the rooms, which wasn't that nice. but none of these really spolied a really enjoyable stay.

"i checked in at the affinia hotel in chicago shortly after dinner on tuesday, i was greeted by very frendly staff from the valet service to front desk. you can tell people were happy at the hotel. i was pleasantly surprised when i got to my room. the room was very well decorated and well thought out. the furniture was in the right location and there was lots of space. plus it was convenient with lots of power outlets the bedroom and washroom was very clean and i had a great sleep in their very comfortable bed. i was told by front desk i could choose from 6 different pillows, although i did not take advantage of this offer i thought what a great idea. once in a while you come across hotels with great service, well thought out rooms in a perfect location (right off magnificent mile). when visiting chicago again i will definitely try and stay at affinia again

"i had a large, roomy, clean 2 bed room with a large bathroom, big minibar snack assortment and was tucked away nicely in the corner so that there was no hall noise. customer service here was absolutely incredible, from the doorman to the front desk, to the gentleman who delivered my toothpaste to my room when i requested it. sure, you get a little outside noise, but it is a big city, that is not unusual! i really enjoyed my stay here and strongly recommend it.

"after reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo, i decided to give this hotel a try. i must say it was a great choice! the location is perfect, just off from n michigan ave, walking distance from everything. the staff was very helpful and friendly, and the room was excellent. they gave us a corner room w/a great view. as many have posted, the bed & pillows were very comfortable (i am very picky about that). i slept well every night! the renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit. i highly recommend this hotel.

",truth
"we got an outstanding rate by signing up for the hotels' website newsletter. affinia has a great location just off michigan avenue near the water tower. beware however: parking is expensive in the gold coast....$48/night. right from the start, victor greeted us and made us feel welcome. check-in was easy and our room was gorgeous. however, it was a handicapped acessible room and i wanted a tub, so one call to the front desk and we had another room. all rooms have been renovated and they are beautiful, comfortable and well appointed. the rooftop bar is a must-do. the outside patio has heaters and candles, a high table for big groups and little groupings of chairs and sofas to get comfy on and enjoy the views. we didn't sit inside the bar area. pedro and quentin were excellent bellmen, and christopher (concierge) was very helpful. as we left, we shook victor's hand (he's always there!) and told him we've found our new chicago hotel!

"the affinia is virtually the perfect hotel for a visit to chicago. my wife and i stayed in an upgraded suite. very large room, that is modern and has all the little touches. the staff was extremely helpful and professional. the location is excellent. the price is a good value for what you get. we simply couldn't find anything to criticize. highly recommended!

"have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted. great bar (draught stella and guinness) which was being upgraded at the end of march when i was last there, good food, lovely staff, large clean rooms, comfortable beds, spot on location for the golden mile, joey's pizzas next door are fantastic. ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please. highly recommended 
",truth
"stayed at the chicago affinia dec 10 thru dec 12 and was very impressed with the staff, the room, and the location. close to shopping and the pizza place next door was great. of course, there were many other restaraunts nearby as well. i had a little trouble figuring out the heat, but it was fine once i learned how to set it. they were working on the hotel, so we got a great rate. but the work never bothered us. the room was great, with the walk-in shower in the spacious bathroom a wonderful surprise. i would definately stay here again and would recommend to others.

"my wife and i stayed at the ambassador east hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-october. we decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of chicago in a week. i'll start out by saying that this was a great experience. at check-in, i indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite. the ambassador east is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the north end of the magnificent mile. it is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on rush. our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed. our suite (on the 3rd floor) had two very large closets, a large ""living room"" and a large bedroom. the bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough. if i would have payed full price for this suite, i probably would have given it a rating of 4, but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and i had such a great time here, i decided to give it a five. it is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful. my wife and i decided to eat at the pump room restaurant, but we were not very impressed. we found the food and service mediocre. the atmosphere was probably pretty neat when sinatra used to eat there back in the day, but not anymore. although we were unimpressed by the pump room, the staff were kind enough to seat us in the ""sinatra booth"" which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains. that neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here. the ambassador east is an older hotel, but it is in a charming older neighborhood. the staff's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me. when we are in chicago again, we will definitely consider staying at the ambassador east again. 
",truth
"our stay at the ambassador east hotel was extremely relaxing and pleasant. we enjoyed the location. we could easily walk to the red line or access the bus lines along michigan avenue. we felt safe walking along the neighborhood streets and viewing the fabulous architecture that is on n. state street and dearborn. we walked to 3rd coast cafe, the chicago history museum, and second city from our hotel. our room was spacious and well-kept, and it was quiet enough for us to take a nap during the afternoon before heading out again in the evening. we would choose to stay there again even if we could afford more expensive locations downtown. we definitely enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the place. 
",truth
"the ambassador east is located in the gold coast neighborhood of chicago. it is just a few blocks from the train station, so it was easy to get anywhere in town. the hotel is a national historic landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. we loved the pump room bar with tons of b & w photos of celebrities. the service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful.

"my stay at the ambassador east was great! the hotel is in a great location in the charming gold coast neighborhood of downtown chicago. gave me the feeling of staying in a chicago neighborhood vs. the concrete jungle of downtown, but the magnificent mile and rush street are just a few blocks from the front door. the staff was very friendly. also, really enjoyed having drinks in the historic pump room. they had a live band on saturday, and i really enjoyed looking at the pictures of the celebrities throughout the lounge that visited from years gone by. definitely recommend it.

"recently returned from a two-night stay at ambassador east hotel. was looking for a comfortable hotel to stay at while visiting family now located in chicago. mission was accomplished. if you would like a quiet, comfortable hotel in a great area - this is it. while some of the furnishings show some signs of their age, it does not detract from the elegant style of the rooms and adds to the comfortable and home-like feeling. found staff to be friendly and helpful. we will be return guests many times in the future for sure. 
",truth
"the staff recognizes you by name with excellent eye contact. the ""welcome back"" sets the tone for your stay. flowers in the lobby and reception area beautiful. the house-keeping staff is terrific, helpful and prompt. room service food was served hot and that makes a big difference too. pump room food was surprising tasty and impressed my clients. well done!

"we just returned from 4 nights at the ambassador east. what a gem! the location in the gold coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the magnificent mile. there is a train station about 2 blocks away. the room was very comfortable, with nice amenities, and there is free internet service on the 2nd floor. best of all was the bell and lobby staff! they really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived. i would say that this was the nicest hotel staff i've encountered in all my travels. 
",truth
"we live down the block from the hotel. we arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away. the floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night. i think the ambassador east was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there. over the years i had had some visiting groups stay there. i had also eaten there and been to the bar but i had never stayed there myself. the lobby is elegant. the service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated. the location is the best residential area in the city (as far as i am concerned -- i live two blocks away) and it is very convenient to north michigan avenue ( a good shopping street) and reasonably convenient to the loop ( the main business area) there are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city. i paid less than $100 including tax for one night. i am not sure what their regular rates are but i think my deal was the best travel bargain around. 
",truth
"be prepared the hotel is old. it is on the historic list. the is updating to be done no doubt.. so just be forewarned. it is clean and the staff is phenomenal. having said that, you can not beat the location. right in the heart of the gold coast. take a train from o'hare right into the city. it drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel. one block from the beach and public transportation is right there. incredible area to explore. i highly recommend the ambassador east 
",truth
"i love the ambassador east, true, she's a little old but she's a classic treasure. the service is wonderful, from the minute you arrive you are greeted warmly and with a nice welcome! i felt the service was good, room was clean and quiet and that all the staff was very accomodating. the biggest gem is the pump room bar and restaurant. the best drinks, amazing food, exciting photographs and fun music on the weekends. this is set in the most fabulous location; historical neightborhood, close to walk the lakefront, well known hometown bars, excellent restaurants chicago has to offer and most of all shopping. there was a nice street market going on over the summer-fall weekends, giving this area a real interesting flavor of chicago. i can see it needs some updating but i was totally happy and content with my stay. i travel a great deal in my work and have seen all kinds of hotels. i will stay here again in the future.

"wow!! where do i start? booked this hotel through hotels.com for less than i paid for the travellodge downtown. check in was a breeze, the entire staff was friendly and helpful. our room was huge. the king bed was very comfortable. our room also had 2 nightstands, 2 chairs with a small table, a desk, and walk-in closet. even with all the furniture, the room was very spacious. the room did show some signs of wear, but i think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel. the hotel is located in a neighborhood, so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. there is very little noise, however, you are only about 2 blocks from rush and division streets, with all the nightlife, and the red line at clark and division is only 3 blocks away. we decided to walk to michigan ave and the next thing we knew, we were at the hancock building. by staying here, you are away from the noise, but not away from the action. had breakfast at the pump room, which is a story in itself. we had our photo taken in booth 1. take some time and research who has sat in this booth. it is impressive. some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the pump room. didn't have a chance to have dinner here, but i will return for dinner someday. breakfast was not anything fancy, and a bit pricy, but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion. the waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was. i can't wait to return here! 
",truth
"in a very nice location close to shopping and places to eat and also in a beautiful neighborhood. a small hotel with a pleasant place to sit in the lobby, the pump room is a classic place to have a drink. we did not have dinner there so i can not comment but we enjoyed people watching while we had an afternoon drink looking out the window at the people in the neighborhood. it is a short walk to very good shopping and eating.

"we also just returned from a frigid weekend in chicago. i booked the ambassador east because of its great rate, $89.00 with my aaa card and we were delighted. yes, the rooms show some signs of wear, but the warmth and charm far make up for it. this was such a pleasant change from the sleek, modern look of many other chain and boutique hotels. we became members of the i preferred program and were therefore eligible for an upgrade which we automatically got upon check in. we had a lovely suite with lots of sitting room and a comfortable bedroom and bathroom. we had wonderful food at the pump room which is classic. our oatmeal there was so tastefully served, i'd love to have some right now! the location was great. had it been normal winter weather, we could have easily walked to michigan avenue for shopping, but due to the minus 20 degree windchills, we opted for a cab which was less than a $5.00 fare. we also enjoyed a glass of wine around the fireplace in the lobby and found it so welcoming and cozy and not overcrowed at all. we would definitely stay here again!

"i loved the ambassador! what a great hotel. it's really beautiful, and the room was absolutely striking, very classic and elegant. everything was done really well: the staff treated me like a regular. this is a top-notch hotel, the best place i've stayed in a long time. my only complaint is that i wish it was on the mile, but that's it.

"just returned from 2 nights at the ambassador and i have to say that i am very happy that i chose this hotel. it is true that this is an older hotel. but it is well kept and it does not lack in style and grandeur. (think of the hotel from the shining, minus the elevator of blood and creepy twins.) from the check-in desk to the surprise turn down service from the maids, i was made to feel like royalty. a special acknowledgment goes out to the doormen who helped me with all my tourist questions. also the location of the hotel is great. close to all the action, but on a quite residential street with beautiful old mansions. i also got a sweet $89 per night room by booking on travelzoo. that was just an added bonus however. even if i paid $200 per night, my impression of the ambassador would not change. highly, highly recommended. 
",truth
"ambassador east is an awesome hotel!!! understand that this hotel is full of history and is a boutique hotel. my family stayed at the ambassador for two nights in a suite. very clean room with great space. the best part of the ambassador is not the rooms though. the staff was extremely courteous, especially the concierge. if you stay here you have to go to the pump room. the restaurant is full of nostalgia, the staff is great, and the food is excellent. great atmosphere and music.

"we stayed at the ae for two nights for a three generation ""girls weekend"" (grandma, mom and daughter). i looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. then i called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named reece. rates were a bit high for the saturday night portion of our stay but when i requested the american girl package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. the american girl package was perfect for us. my 8 year old daughter was thrilled. they give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. they have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). she also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. our room, 1334, was large and clean. it had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. the employees are all very friendly and helpful. we had a drink in the pump room but did not eat there. we ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd coast. this hotel is north of michigan ave. but it is just a short, pleasant walk to the mag. mile. i would definately stay here again in chicago.

"we booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on hotwire over labor day weekend. we arrived at the hard rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. hooray! we were on the 5th floor (beatles theme). the rooms were very comfortable. one of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. the other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, the bathroom was full of aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. the tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. we were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. no problems there. we did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. my husband was able to go for a run through grant park along the waterfront instead. he said it was wonderful. we did use the free internet in our rooms. it was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. the room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. there was virtually no hall / elevator noise. the location of the hard rock is ideal. it is easy to get breakfast at the corner bakery, just blocks to either grant park, the art institute, state street shopping, or michigan ave. to sum up, there was absolutely nothing to complain about. we would be glad to stay here again any time. 
",truth
"got a great deal through hotwire for $70 a night but if i ever return to chicago i would definitely stay again, even at full price. we really liked the rooms muted modern decor, we had john lennon and bono for company. comfortable bed, mini coffe maker, plenty storage space and a lovely, clean bathroom stocked full of aveda products (so i was sold straight away...it doesn't take much, i know!). if you're a product junkie, tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies :) we liked the location and had a great view down n michigan ave, found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed (reception, gift shop and bar). the bar area is very trendy, i liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause i normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking...the lack of memorabilia didn't bother me but i was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway. the only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh, and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a ""friendly lady looking for business"" when he was at the bar. i think it's a place you will either love or hate, if you like laid back, contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you!

"this is a stylish hotel located right on north michigan avenue, a five minute walk from the orange ""loop"" line that will get you to and from midway airport. forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft, we were told). decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. on the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. no kidding. the bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. on the positive side, however, there were aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. the king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. we had a largish tv with a dvd player. there is a safe and munchies. the gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. it is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. there are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to l2 to get to the gym. this way you dont have to traverse the lobby. the front desk staff is amiable, and very attentive. i read some other reviews about nasty personnel, but did not have that experience at all. i got a free newspaper with a smile, a free stamp when i needed it, change and all the coffee i could tolerate in the morning. the hard rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the water tower, the drury theater, john hancock, and magnificent mile. for those who like a thrifty breakfast, we recommend gourmet pantry at 155 n. michigan avenue [--]. this deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a sunday morning, no less: $1.99. the hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person, but we did not partake of it. we would stay at the hard rock again, and think it is great for people with ""tweens."" not sure about the toddler set, though.

"i stayed here august 20 through 23rd with my sixteen year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. the price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on michigan avenue. the front desk and concierge service was excellent and enhanced our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities. the john entwistle theme on our floor was a nice touch. any of you single fathers out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and the hard rock hotel in chicago really helped me accomplish just that!

"stayed for 3 nights for our anniversary. the desk clerk was great and since it was our anniversary, he gave us an upgrade...imagine our surprise when we got off on a floor with only 3 other rooms! corner tower suite with a view of the river and michigan ave. beautiful! cabs available right outside the lobby... never paid more than $7 for a cab ride. if you go in dec. you must go to the chriskindl festival for strudel!

"the service from check-in to checkout was excellent - timely and efficient. the room was more then i has expected. it was spacious and laid out very well. i particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower. the bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable. i believe it's the first time i stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room. the location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go. i particularly enjoyed the excellent food at thechina grill which is attached to the hard rock hotel. the service was very good and the staff very friendly.

"i was attending a conference at the mariott. they were booked up and i shared a room at the hard rock for a week by default. what a lucky break. this is a beautiful hotel. i am not a fan of all that black/grey vibe and find it a little cheesy. what i loved was the way the hard rock left the beautiful old hotel features intact, and decorated around the basic stucture. my room was clean, clean, clean. i want to comment on the staff. what an upbeat group of people. this included the doormen, the front desk, the consierge. they were wonderful! every morning one of the bell men would find my tv morning news show for me in the bar, while i drank their courtesy coffee. they brought us a refrigerator, ipod dock, and extra suitcase stand within minutes of check-in. i had a hard time contacting the airport transport. the consierge took care of it for me. while i was waiting for the 4:50 am airport shuttle, one of the bell men found me a cup of coffee in the back. i just couldn't get over how nice and friendly everyone was....great place to stay. i hope to go back with my husband.

"this is a great hotel, in a great location, in a great city !!! there's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part. the rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s) in the bathroom ... i had the beatles and although they're not my cup of tea, i was happy enough with george staring back @ me! the hotel itself is on the corner of michigan ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the ""cheesecake factory"" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the ""john hancock centre"". a slighty longer walk (or a short cab ride) and you're at the ""navy pier"" - take a ride on the ""seadog"" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music. this hotel (& city) is well worth checking out.

"awesome hotel, our room overlooked michigan ave and we could see the river. very stylish, trendy room and hotel. lacked a bit in amenities (pool, etc) but more than made up for it with the location and quality of the hotel. booked it thought hotwire for $99 which was awesome value.

"the hard rock is glossy and sexy, but an absolutely fantastic hotel.... i was in town for business and stayed here because of it's location, but i absolutely understand why tourists would like it...right on the river, cool art deco building and millenium park is just down the street. regardless- the room was clean, the staff was friendly, but not annoying and the bar was fun. i was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were good! i'll definitely try it again! 
",truth
"the hard rock hotel chicago has become my favorite hotel. i've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience. as you might have guessed - it has a super rock & roll theme, with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor's elevator lobby. the rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians. you can request being on the floor of your favorite band (like kiss, aerosmith, etc...) the rooms are great. well appointed. super comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows. the large tv has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience. there's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar. i've always had a room with big windows and a view down michigan ave (the hotel sits right on michigan - a block from the canal). the bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design... some of the showers have windows in side of them (you can shower and enjoy the view down michigan!) or close the waterproof drapes. i've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here... front desk, doorman, etc are all great. there's a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy. big screen tv to catch the latest scores, too. of course, rock & roll music pumps thru the place. you can stay at a ""plain"" hotel anywhere... but this is a great, well designed, fun and memorable hotel that you'll want to return back to. if i had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight. my daily car parking rate was close to $50 per night, which i'm sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop. stay here. be cool.

"a bunch of us got together and we had a great time in this hotel we asked for limes and they gave us like a punch bowl of them the rooms were so awesome you really have to see it to believe how extradionary this hotel is i love the decorations on every floor and being surrounded by such elegance. will definitely stay here again

"we stayed at the hard rock on january 27th, 2009 for $125/night. it is located on michigan ave, just two blocks from the mag mile, two blocks from millenium park, and five blocks from the chicago art institute. our hotel room was very nice with views of michigan ave and a unusually comfy bed. the hotel even offered free coffee in the lobby every morning and free wifi in the rooms. parking was $45 for valet and $30 for self parking. the staff was very helpful with all of our request. 
",truth
"the hard rock hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into chicago.. the location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as lake michigan, millennium park, and art museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from. my co-works loved the exterior of the building, views from the rooms, the art on the walls, and crisp, clean & hip feeling of the hotel, but not ""too over the top"" for ""business"". by far a better experience than your usual ""chain"" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms. here you feel special...for the same price. the lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on michigan ave (or catch a real rock star in the lobby!) 
",truth
"stayed here for 4 nights in apri. from check in the stay was perfect all round, staff were so helpfuly and friendly especially chris and scott. the location couldn't be better right on michigan avenue so easy access to everything. room was lovely and spacious and always clean and tidy at the end of the day. will definately recommend it to friends and family.

"my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york. the room was very spacious and clean, the bed was huge and extremely comfortable. i really liked the aveda bathroom products, great smell. we had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot. compliments to the chef. the concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to navy pier, directions were given to us accompanied by a map. the weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show, this was spectacular. the whole of the last day of the show we spent at navy pier and the millenium park. location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping. if we are ever in chicago again we will definately stay here. 
",truth
"very quaint and romantic, yet masculine. i've noticed that at most chicago hotel bars it's hard to get a drink much less a seat but i guess because it's a small hotel that was not a problem at the talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that! would love to stay again but i must say that i was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm. also note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout! 
",truth
"my girlfriends and i stayed 4 nights at the talbott returning home on saturday 9/29. we all had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. the staff from top to bottom were excellent, accommodating. the room was roomy...with our only complaint being not being able to cool the room fast enough after a day on the town. the construction next door was obstructing the sidewalk, but being on a oneway street limited that difficulty. the doorman, andrew was an excellent source at this hotel. he arranged all our transportation at night to restaurants. we enjoyed everything about the hotel and the city. the hotel was expensive but met expectations. 
",truth
"my wife and i just spent 3 nights at the talbott. the room was spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. the hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby. linens and towels first-class. free wi-fi in the room. the location is terrific, just one block to michigan avenue. we will stay here on future visits. 
",truth
"as we pulled away in a taxi heading to the airport for our trip home my wife turned to me and said ""we picked the right place."" having chosen the talbott from other trip advisor reviews i found myself thinking in terms of a trip advisor review when we arrived. nice entrance, friendly reception, i noticed everything and immediately knew the talbott was a non-corporate warm hotel with touches not typically seen in big name hotel chains. the smell of the elevator and attention to decorative details strongly reminded me of europe, simple, not overstated but elegant. the location is great, there was light snow but we walked to the art institute, rush street, the theater district, and we're from california where anything below 50 degrees keeps us inside! all i can say is if you are the kind of traveler that wants comfort, class and somewhere unique, stay at the talbott. oh yeah, we were in a room that looked down at the construction, we were on the 15th floor and could not hear a sound, it was very quiet. 
",truth
"i have just returned from a lovely shopping trip to chicago. it is a very nice hotel, and i will love to stay there if i visit chicago again! there is a lot of positive to say about the hotel; staff is excellent, never experienced such an excellent service -- that alone is worth coming back for. was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast. a few things that could make this hotel even better... a hand shower in the bathroom. the hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom, instead of the bathroom, when the bathroom is all damp after a shower i prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair. free internet access in the lobby. i was surprised i had to pay 6 or 7 usd (for 15 minutes) to log-on and check-in with my airline (only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying?!?!?!?) 
",truth
"we loved our stay at the talbott. we were in chicago to attend the theater show dirty dancing. we booked our room through orbitz and received a nice discount. when we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy. we were upgraded to a king bed suite. the suite was well decorated and spacious. my wife particularily enjoyed the heat that could be directed at the marble floor in the bathroom. we loved the hotel and will definitely stay at the talbott on our next trip to chicago. highly recommended. 
",truth
"my wife and i stayed two nights at the talbott at the end of february. this little hotel was the perfect place for us. the lobby is very small but also cozy, and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold. the staff was very friendly and efficient. the room was pretty spacious, and the king bed was extremely comfortable. we had a seventh floor room facing delaware st, so there was really no view. the bathroom was a good size, including two sinks and a spacious tub/shower. there was also free wireless internet...a big plus for us. perhaps the best thing about the talbott is the location. we were only a few steps from state, rush, and north michigan. tons of shopping, bars, and good food are easily within walking distance. this makes the talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in. we highly recommend the talbott, and will gladly stay again on return trips. 
",truth
"location, location, location. what a great find! excellent, well-run, small boutique-type hotel on a tree-lined street near all the action without being in the oppressive crunch of it. rooms are good-sized and clean; good bed and shower with tub. the air conditioner, as mentioned in other reviews, is noisy, but it's a minor complaint. the staff is simply wonderful and attentive from housecleaning to concierge. the on site restaurant is great. the red-line el is about 3-4 blocks away which makes getting around the city a breeze. you are footsteps away from rush street and north michigan avenue and lake michigan. i would not have a moment's hesitation booking at this hotel again in the future; in fact, i wouldn't book anywhere else. 
",truth
"we stayed here because of all the great reviews, and it's all true. we were highly impressed with the high quality of everything, everyone, and the location. walking distance to much of what chicago has to offer. gibson's steakhouse and the hancock building to name a couple. this hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for chicago. it should also have more than three stars. i mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard, and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those. depending on the room you get, any price under $250 would be a good deal. between 250 - 300 could still be worth it. 
",truth
"i stayed at the talbott twice in the last few weeks. i was very pleased with every facet of my stays. the staff, from doormen to front desk, to concierge, to housekeeping, were wonderful. the rooms were nicely sized and clean, and well stocked. i will return to the talbott anytime! 
",truth
"my husband and i stayed here for three nights while visiting chicago as tourists. what a beautiful hotel! our room was lovely, the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient. they don't have an in house gym, but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street. the restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast. the concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there. we were able to walk down the magnificent mile from our hotel, as well as through the gold coast and old towne neighborhoods. there are tons of great restaurants in the area (including the famous gibsons and the signature room in the hancock tower) as well as lots of shopping. there is currently a lot of construction going on near the talbott (they are building condos right behind it), but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting chicago. 
",truth
"we booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night. we walked over to the talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay. the room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom. the tub is large and the shower a pleasure. the location was quiet as requested. the staff was always cheerful and very helpful. tim and stephanie provide excellent concierge services! the breakfast at the basil cafe is a great way to start the day. we travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel. i would highly recommend the talbott for your stay. 
",truth
"stayed 5 nights at this great hotel. updated rooms. clean. used tim to book theater and dinning reservations. provided excellent service. close to subway, shopping and dinning. excellent value. free wireless internet and access to nearby health club very nice perks. highly recommend it. future concern is adjacent construction of condos. not a problem while we were there but something to ask front desk about in the future. 
",truth
"stayed at the talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay. room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift, but everything else made up for that. positives: bed was very comfortable, great to have real shower, free internet, gym usage, staff (all friendly) and location. negative: lift noise, lifts slow and restaurant (there are so many great restaurants around - don't bother staying in) would stay again! 
",truth
"just returned from a 3 night stay at the talbott. this was our first visit there, and i can honestly say that i wouldn't stay at any other hotel in chicago. from when we first were greated by the bell captain until our final departure, the staff was nothing less than amazing, always greeting with a smile and can i help you attitute. the room we had (1508) was very spacious and comfortable. the bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and i have ever slept in (including the four seasons). had great breakfasts and drinks at basil's. you would be missing a fantastic experience, if you didn't stay at the talbott. 
",truth
"i stayed at the talbott for 3 nights on business and was very pleased. the staff was friendly as can be immediately confirming the lore of the midwest. i was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. the free wi-fi came in handy as i needed to work remotely while there. everything from the comfort of the bed to the staff and location made this a great stay. oh, and i got to workout at the huge equinox right next door for free. 
",truth
"we loved the talbott. the location was fabulous...very close to the shopping. the hotel is smaller, but the rooms are very nice. they are very spacious and are able to be darkened to sleep well. also, the beds are some of the most comfortable i have ever slept in. i might also add that our room at queen beds. the staff is all friendly and puts them themselves out for you. the hotel has a cute outdoor eating area on the sidewalk that has flowers, etc. it looks like a scene out of europe. i would highly recommend the hotel. we were there with our daughters; ages 10 and 13.

"my husband attended a conference in chicago for the weekend of june 22nd and i decided to tag along for the shopping! we flew into o'hare and took a cab to the hotel, cost about $30. everybody from the doorman to reception desk to concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. we had a room on the 9th floor which overlooked the construction, but we were hardly in the room so it didn't bother us. we were also never awakened due to construction noise and my husband is a very light sleeper. the room was clean and spacious enough for us. the bed is very comfy. we ate in the restaurant downstairs several times for breakfast and lunch and all meals were great. the location of this hotel is perfect. you are about 1&1/2 blocks from michigan ave and the hancock tower. can't beat that! there is also an adorable pet store called tails in the city across from the hotel! i brought our dog back a couple of toys! they are very nice as well. all in all, no complaints. the hotel is clean and beyond what we were expecting. the staff is always friendly and the location is superb. it's a safe neighborhood-i walked around by myself and felt fine. we would definitely return. 
",truth
"this is a great find for downtown chicago. the price is right and the staff are excellent. as noted, there is construction going on around the hotel, but i didn't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping. i asked for a quiet room on an upper floor, and was gladly given one. the lobby is small, the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel. the concierge, stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations (along with a complimentary appetizer). we had a standard room, and it was spacious, tastefully decorated--everything we needed. the bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking--and the mp3 compatible radio was a nice perk. just can't say enough about how nice the staff are--every single person you meet. would definitely stay here again.

"chicago is one of our favorite cities to visit. some friends suggested trying the talbott. i'm delighted we took them up. the talbott is a great ""small"" hotel a block and a half off of michigan avenue near the four seasons, drake and westin. the concierge staff was most helpfull. gene and stephanie took great care of us. the rooms were spacious and very fresh. the elevators could be a bit slow at times. aside from the construction next door, our stay was perfect. bice now runs the hotel restaurant. we enjoyed having breakfast there. we will stay there again.

"i just left the conrad chicago and have nothing but good things to say. we used hilton points to stay there but paid $35/night to upgrade to a junior suite. we were in room 1519. i would reccomend people ask for an odd numbered room so that they will have a view looking north on michigan ave. our room was very modern with 2 large hd/flat panel tv and bose 3 speaker sound system. 4 big windows that actually open. the bed lineds were very nice, the towels were ok. the room was clean and the bath room had a seperate shower and tub. marble everywhere. robes, slippers, etc. the work out room was good with different machines and some free weights. there are clean towels in the workout room too. we never ate in the hotel so i can't comment on the food or the prices. there is a starbucks across the street (michigan) and an espresso bar attached to the nordstrom that is on the ground floor of the hotel. it was very nice to have the little mall right under the hotel. the location of the hotel could not be better. we were walking distance to everything. every kind of shopping or dinning experience you could possibly want was within 2 miles. over all the hotel had a boutique feel to it even though it is part of the hilton chain. 
",truth
"my wife and i came to spend the weekend in downtown chicago for shopping and we found this conrad hotel well located close to everything downtown and of a size that doesn't make you feel lost in the convention world. we have had this feeling when staying at larger hotels in the past. our suite has view on michigan avenue with a bit of the lake at the end. staff was very professional, pleasant and friendly making us feel very comfortable. internet is free n the rooms and i am making my review from there.

"we have just returned from 4 nights at the conrad chicago, everthing about the hotel was excellent. wonderful room and service from all the staff was first class. great view from our room. the hotels location is great, right in the centre of the magnificent mile. a wonderful stay in an amazing city was made perfect by our stay at the conrad. 
",truth
"we spent a week in this hotel and were very pleased with the experience. as described in previous reviews. the room was very comfortable with the huge televison and bathroom being particularly outstanding. service was excellent overall (i especially liked the bottle of water at my bedside with the turn down service). the door and bellmen/women were particularly pleasant and helpful and the concierge was friendly and knowledgeable. we had completely satisfactory (though overpriced) drinks in the bar but didn't eat at the restaurant. the health club was fine and the equipment was well maintained. while there were only three treadmills and two elipitical steppers, i never had to wait for a machine although it might be a different story in the dead of a chicago winter! one minor quibble--i like to have coffee first thing in the morning and there was no in-room coffee maker. the restaurant offered free coffee ""to-go"" but only before eight am. this is a very, very comfortable, attractive hotel in a wonderful location. chicago is an expensive city but we felt that we got a reasonable value for our money.

"arrived on 06/04/05, greeted by friendly doorman, and zipped up to the 5th floor lobby. very open lobby area with friendly reception staff. room was on the 12th floor and very nice. everything was in order and very clean! the king size bed was nice and each night i had a restful sleep. bathroom was large with separate glass shower stall. the room was furnished with everything i needed including internet hook-up access. also, you can walk thru on the 5th fl to the westfield north bridge shopping mall, where you will enjoy nordstrom and other stores. of course, you're steps from michigan ave. too. the central location of the hotel was great, as i could walk to most places. the cta subway stop (grand ave. on red line) was an easy 2 block walk. i will stay here again on my next trip to chicago!

"my husband and i decided to take a trip to chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the conrad, not really knowing it's location. we were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on michigan ave.

"we usually stay at the sofitel but thought we would try the conrad for a change. i don't think i would rate this hotel over the sofitel but it was still 1st class. but i do think the service was better at the conrad. we arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left. normally service goes down hill then but our waiter eric was the best. even when i kept ordering my after dinner ports. the meal may not have been the chop house but it was still very good. the bar was ok, no crown reserve. they did have the cask 16 at $24 a drink, ouch. the room service was very quick. our room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the ashtrays during their visits. the only fault we could find was the temperature on the 14th floor. it was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off. which wasn't so bad since my wife smokes. the temp on the 5th where the lobby, bar, and restaurant was fine. we enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in sept. one last thing, if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast. go to the west egg, only a few blocks away.

"my boyfriend and i decided to stay at the conrad chicago for our anniversary. the second we walked in, we were immediately won over by the look and feel of the room. white luxurous bedding on the king bed, plasma t.v./ subroofer/ surround sound speakers (my boyfriend was more impressed than me, as i reminded him that we didn't come to chicago for the hotel room) very large bathroom w/ tub and separate stand-in shower, granite countertops, his/ her robes and slippers. the view wasn't great, but we were on the 6th floor and not really high enough to see anything but the side of the building next to us. not a large room by any means, but again . . . we didn't go to the city for the hotel room. it was the prefect size for the amount of time we were actually in the room. we got a great rate on it ($140 at hotels.com) but i think the going rate is usually closer to mid $200's. i've stayed in quite a few hotels in the downtown area and none have ever impressed me more than this one. we will definitely be staying there again on our next trip into the city.

"this was a weekend trip for my friends and i. we booked a couple of rooms and asked in advanced for the reservations to be connected in some way. our rooms were right next to one another as requested. as it was almost everyone's first time to chicago, we had to do a bit of cold-searching for a hotel. and, our choice was next to perfect. i had an amazing time during my first visit to chicago and it was largely due to this hotel. the customer service was amazing. everyone was extremely nice and helpful. one of our rooms ordered late night room service and raved about how they felt they had ordered a 5 star lunch because it was as fresh as having ordered food at 2 pm, and delicious. my friend suggested they had a full-staff at 3 am because the food came up quickly too. in another of our rooms, housekeeping had accidentally discarded a cd when replacing the cd player with an ipod dock. the concierge had the exact cd purchased and ready at check-out from the neighboring record store. our rate included complimentary breakfast which was fantastic! everything was freshly made in their kitchen too. an added bonus was that the hotel is attached to a mall. therefore, you don't need to leave the building to get a pair of shoes, a coffee, or a some other type of trinket. i was beyond pleased with this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation.

"we stayed in the conrad for 4 nights just before thanksgiving. we had a corner room overlooking n michigan av and the tribune building. to say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful. the staff were unbelievably helpful. the standard of the room was superb - hd plasma screens, luxury bedlinens, ipod radio, huge bathroom. location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole light festival parade from the window. breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service. would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5.

"we got a great deal on this hotel, just $91 found through travelzoo. we only stayed one night, but were very impressed. the sevice was fantastic from the moment we stepped up to the property. the hotel smelled wonderful and was immaculate. our room, while not enormous was perfect. we had a great view of the city and lake. the bed was extremely comfortable. we never heard any noise outside of our room. the bathroom was nice sized considering we must have had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel, two could get ready very comfortably. location was perfect, just off michigan ave and steps away from millenium park. we would definetly stay here again, especially if we could get this great deal!

"the reviews we read were a bit mixed, but i thought it was excellent. i've stayed in the splendido, villa d'este and others and it doesn't compare, but nor should it. it doesn't claim to be in that space. i expected it to be a notch off the four seasons and so it proved. a only a small notch too!. lovely clean and bright room. superb views, very quiet, comfy bed etc. excellent service all round and nice staff. for the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed. couldn't really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the four seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience. we will go there again when in chicago. great location too.

"i vacationed at the fairmont chicago for 3 nights in july 2009. the room, the bathroom, the view, and the staff were all wonderful. i just wish the hotel were a few blocks north (on mi ave). sometimes, when you're tired, that extra couple of blocks seem like miles!

"for the price of the marriott we spent a night here ($122 + tax) and had an enjoyable if brief stay. as others have noted the hotel has been recently renovated, and the rooms are furnished with attractive and sleek scandanavian-type design. the staff was polite and attentive, and seemed to match the redesign with a hip kind of feel. the parking is pricey at $49, so i used an adjacent lot and self-parked, and as others have noted, the lack of water-pressue in the shower was disappointing. good location. would return, esp as this pricepoint.

"i recently stayed at the fairmont chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in aria restaurant, to the maid who cleaned my room. the rooms were recently updated, with large flat-screen tv's, beautiful linens, and exceptional toiletries in each room. my room even had a view of monroe st. harbor. it is truly a first-rate hotel. location is south of the river and east of michigan ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way (if that's possible in downtown chicago), however its location significantly lowers street noise. the hotel has excellent access to millennium park, the aon center (there is a connecting concourse), and is about 4 blocks from shopping on north michigan ave. i ate dinner in aria and it was fantastic! room service for breakfast was quite good as well. overall, i'd stay again in a minute if i had business in the loop, or leisure plans in millennium or grant parks.

"i stayed at the fairmont to attend a conference. i was very pleased with the hotel. the doorman offered me an umbrella as i headed out for a walk... and sure enough it started to rain very soon after- i would have been soaked with it. upon my return, the doorman then asked about my walk, etc. this is reflective of all the staff i encountered. the front desk promptly checked me in. definitely register for their rewards program before you arrive... the complimentary gym access is excellent, plus you save on internet access fees which are waived for members. the bathroom and separate dressing areas were large and convenient. the only negative- no coffee maker! and the starbucks in the adjacent building is closed on weekends since the area corporate offices are closed those days!!! otherwise my stay was perfect, considering the conference rate was $99 per night!

"we went to chicago to see an exhibit at the art institute and selected the fairmont because it was so close. although the lobby is still being renovated, our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive. the room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate. the only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished. the maid does not do that, and by bedtime on the first night, we still didn't have coffee. we called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply. the restaurant is a little underwhelming, but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks, we probably wouldn't have eaten there any more than we did. after having stayed in close to a dozen different chicago hotels, this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return.

"from the moment i stepped up to the front entrance my luxury service began! i enjoyed every minute @ the fairmont! the king room was spacious and the decor chic! the coffee maker was the coolest and the bathroom is huge! i really like the separate shower, tub, and separate door for the toilet. the desserts and cheese spread at eno so yummy. before the fairmont the w hotel was my favorite chain of hotels to stay at.

"simply a nice place to stay... i had a great deal for the room, and was impressed with the quality. hotel staff was very helpful; they were able to let me check out and helped me print boarding passes. negative: it is frustrating that nowadays you do not have free internet in most hotels and it's the same here; you have to pay for the internet. negative: loud on the phone you may hear your neighbors on the phone, or them shower.

"i stayed at the fairmont chicago for one night - i'm a frequent business traveler and am very familiar with travel rituals. i checked in late (almost 10pm) due to flight cancellations from my home airport -- atlanta. i took the shuttle to the airport (best option in lieu of the over priced taxis), and it was my first time staying at the hotel. upon arrival, i immediately noticed the entrance, which appeared very welcoming and warm to me. i checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if i'd prefer a king or double (reconfirming my reservation preference). i always take the king when i can, and the bed was fantastic! it was suited with great linen and these incredible down & feather pillows named encompass made by the pillow factory -- i checked the tags, since i plan to buy some! i ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - aria, which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and yes, it does stand out all on it's own. the food is asian fusion, and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie, i appreciate great food when i taste it! the hotel service was good as well. only drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely. they missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet, which tasted a bit 'metallic'. but they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after i passed on the buffet. i would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view (if you can get a room with one), fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet.

"we got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in chicago on 7/24/09. we went thru priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $69 (normal rate was around $200). the room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed. hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to michigan ave so the location is very convenient. parking is very expensive at $50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $30. we decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere. we ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict. they were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we didn't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast. glad we didn't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better. i highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your chicago visit.

"i stayed at the fairmont during a professional conference. while i have to say that for a conference, some of the meeting rooms were too small, in terms of traveler's comfort the hotel is exceptional! i can't think of a single thing about my room that wasn't perfect. the accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many chicago attractions.

"nestled just off the beaten path and about two blocks from the river the fairmont chicago offers an excellent location to operate as home base for your trip to chicago. the staff were friendly and helpful, arranging many of the sightseeing events we enjoyed while in the city. there are many attractions withiin easy walking distance (the art institute is a must see and millenium park is a fun visit). the architectural tour by river departs a dock that is very close to the fairmont and there are lots of restaurants nearby. the rooms were excellent and the club room is worth the extra expense. we would definitely stay here again. 
",truth
"we recently completed our second stay at the fairmont chicago. the check-in process was quick and painless but the front desk staff was almost disinterested in the whole procedure. that is fine when i am traveling on business, but on leisure trips i would appreciate a warmer greeting. the hotel was hosting a convention at the same time as our stay, but other than seeing some signage/attendees in the lobby, we wouldn't have noticed. this is probably due to the separation of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 speedy elevators. we stayed in a parkview suite so we had a large room with a great view of millenium park. the anteroom was well appointed with a sofa, coffee table, desk, mini-bar with sink and coffee maker, and dining area. the bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard fairmont room, but maybe slightly larger. the bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard fairmont room, and once again, possibly slightly larger. the upscale modern decor is pleasing but not overtly luxurious, and several small touches such as a shoe shine station (with extra collar tabs), are peppered throughout. we booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly handled. the hotel restaurant, aria, couldn't find our reservation but they oddly new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us. they had no problem seating us and the dinner (both food and service) was lovely. minor complaints: the pillows could be better. i'm not sure if they remembered our preference for non-down bedding from our last visit, but seriously, these things barely felt like pillows. i'll suffer through some congestion if i can get better neck support. also, the valet parking attendants seem overly eager to take your car (and charge you $49). and as i mentioned above, the front desk experience could be improved. best feature: after our first stay, i gave a brief review in the comments section of the fairmont president's club (membership is free) website. i received a phone call from the director of rooms the same day asking to discuss our experience. after this stay, i left a comment essentially thanking the hotel staff for a great stay, but still received a warm, friendly phone call from the director of rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay. kudos to the fairmont for taking its customers seriously, and for that, they've won my loyalty.

"we stayed at the fairmont two nights for the sofa art fair at the navy pier. i was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and pronounced it correctly, which is quite unusual. everyone smiled and welcomed us. the lobby looks clean and friendly, not ultramodern, but not at all tired or worn. our room, also clean and comfortably furnished, was larger than we expected, with a clean, modern bath and a lovely view of the navy pier and the lake. we did not eat at the restaurant, but it looked attractive. our only problem was that we had asked for non-feather pillows, upon reserving the room, upon checking in, and calling housekeeping. after waiting an hour, we went to bed. the next day the check-in desk person was extremely apologetic and by the time we returned, all the feathers were replaced with foam and non-allergenic materials. the hotel is convenient to millenium park and michigan ave. we would stay there again, assuming we could get good rates. 
",truth
"the concierge was so helpful. without hesitation they had the best recommendations for restaurants and attractions all turning out to be wonderful. they even gave us business cards for restaurants that did not take reservations so we could obtain preferential or immediate seating's. loved the health club at the back of the hotel. by joining the presidents club, it only cost ten dollars a day to use the facilities. the rooms were large, updated and had views looking out in 3 directions. the coffee maker in the room was exceptional. location is great for getting mostly anywhere. parking is overpriced so we took our cart to the underground millennium garage that was only $25.00 per 24 hours and a few blocks walk from the hotel.

"i stayed at the fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent. i was given a very large room with great views of the city; the breakfast was extremely good; and the location was as central as i could have wished for. the pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims. in the evening i spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too. highly recommended as a base for exploring chicago.

"i got a sunday night stay for only $50 off of priceline.com, so it would be hard to complain...but this was truly a great hotel, even if i paid double. the first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the hyatt regency chicago is wow. the lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant, plenty of couches,seats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains. you take the escalator to the concierge/directory/check in area. the hotel let me check in at 12pm (i had a 3pm check in time). i suggest you call ahead like i did so they know you are coming early.the women at the desk was friendly and when i requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me ""i have a room on the 18th floor with a veiw of the river or you can go higher with no view"". i thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that i wouldnt get stuck with a room with a view of a wall. the rooms are big (i had a doubles room) the beds were beautiful with great pillows,blankets,headboards etc. an ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room. great to plug in your ipod, listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring chicago. the view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries. another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. you simply look at the screen, click on your airline icon and following the instructions. i had my boarding passes in about a minute. came in handy when i got to ohare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers. i was only in the hotel for 1 day, but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences i have had and i travel alot. it is a business hotel, but definitely a great choice for families and couples. definitely would stay here again when im passing through chicago.

"we stayed at omni chicago for 2 nights in early july (july 1-3). the reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on travelzoo. we got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for food&beverages. i also signed up for their loyalty program, which was so worth it. i was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second-class guest because of the price we paid. but i was totally wrong! they treated us extremely well. before our arrival, i got an email asking if we needed anything. so, i asked for a fridge to store the baby milk. and they arranged it for us without charge :) we arrived late on thursday night. our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge i requested. we were given a corner suite on the 10th floor...very nice room...comfy bed. my husband was really wowwwww!!! the bed was made ready for us - both in the bedroom and the sofa-bed (we didn't use the sofa-bed though). we got a high-speed internet as part of the loyalty program. all staff were friendly and helpful...front desk, valet parking, bell boy, room service, concierge,... everyone! we used the voucher for room-service breakfasts both morning. the first day was great. food was great, and quick. we also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program. we ordered oj and hot chocolate. they both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning. but we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible. it tasted like left-over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate :( also, we ordered belgian waffle for our breakfast, which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries...but we got a plain waffle. so, we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those. this is why i didn't give ""5"" for service. however, i reported these issues to the front-desk when checking out, and the front-desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal. another thing is that it's quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor. we could hear siren going on & off during the night. but this is out of the hotel's control though. and i would say that it didn't bother us at all. my baby could sleep very well. overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely consider omni for our next trip to chicago.

"at the last minute, my son and i decided to take a quick trip to chicago to see the cubs. after checking priceline i decided to book the omni because of the great price for airfare and hotel. we arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was ready(i had called ahead and requested early arrival).the front desk treated us like we were there best customers-very friendly and accomodating. the room was wonderful with all the modern conviences you would expect in an upscale hotel. the room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. there was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous review-maybe those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their room!!!we then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch. our service was great as was the food. we also tried several restaurants around the omni-all within walking distance. the service, cleanliness and location of the omni were incredible. we will definitely go back.

"i'll keep it short. my wife, daughter and i stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. we go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel. location: it is located in the center of the magnificent mile (michigan ave.), so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do. hotel: the hotel itself is very clean, as were the rooms. maid service was excellent, including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service (i think they missed a night). service: every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind. they always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile. every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room (sometimes chocolates on our pillows). they always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it. there was no shortage of people to ask things. my only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get. they shouuld have more than one, or longer hours. other: we had breakfast in the 676 restaurant and it was very good, and well attended, appointed. they even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet. the pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids. it was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking. pool and changing areas were spotless. room: clean, sunny and spacious. probably over 400 sq. ft. - 2 tvs, couch, desk, chairs - all in perfect shape. the windows open for some fresh air. pillows were pretty comfortable. with all aspects considered, i think this was an unbeatable value! i would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend. i truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel. it was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there. omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number. the airlines have cornered the market on that. 
",truth
"we arrived at the omni on 2nd september for a 6 day stay. i took ill when i left the plane after travelling from manchester so i saw more of the room than i anticipated. i couldn't go out for 4 days. the room was spacious and clean. the bed was extremely comfortable. the bathroom was large and very clean. what more could you ask. we had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested. i managed to go to the 5th floor to see the sun terrace (outside the gym) having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit grim. a few sunbeds on a concrete floor. there was also noise from an air conditioning unit. it could do with a bit of cheering up. what i saw of chicago was very pleasing, it has something for everyone. would i go back to the omni? yes i would.

"we have stayed at several high end places in chicago and this is still our favorite. location is superb, staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying. cornell, at the front desk, is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge. we love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program, high speed internet is gratis, as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing. bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains! we have never had a bad stay at this hotel.

"just got back from 2 days up in chicago shopping with girlfriends. first time i have stayed at the omni. i did so because i saw a $129.00 rate that included $25.00 of free food on travelzoo. the three of us (55 year olds) all stayed in one suite with 2 double beds and a very comfortable pull out sofa. we had plenty of room. food in the restaurant was great, service was outstanding from everone we came into contact with, early morning delivery of free coffee, juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat, time of movies, shopping areas, etc was really helpful. need i mention the outstanding location? simply the best! we all decided that the omni is our new favorite hotel.

"we just returned from our first trip to chicago and stayed at the omni. i read many reviews on trip advisor and picked the omni based on its wonderful reviews and they were right on. the location, staff, rooms, amenities, etc were all wonderful. huge thank you to ta members who suggested signing up for the preferred member program. we did that before we left and received complimentary beverages in the morning and newspapers among other perks. i loved being woken up to fresh orange juice and the chicago tribune newspaper. we were in room 816 which was perfect. corner suite with two out of the 3 sides of the rooms being windows with a great view. the room was huge with a gorgeous king bed and great living area with plasma tv. the bathroom amenities were wonderful. i loved soaking in the tub with the mineral salts that were provided. the turn down service was great as well. we would come back to our room with relaxing music playing and our bed ready for us. we ate at their restaurant twice and the breakfast buffet was delicious. the blueberry muffins were the best i have ever had. everything was so fresh and prepared perfectly. the staff at the omni is so accomodating. everyone is always smiling and asking you how your stay is. have to thank the concierge melissa and curtis. they were both so helpful with great dining suggestions and maps for everything we wanted to do. i also used the gym during my stay and it was great. all the machines were top notch and each treadmill has a lcd tv attached. and the gym itself had two plasmas. they also had cold lemon water for you after your workout. i am a stickler for cleanliness and it was sparkling every morning. it really was a fantastic stay at the omni and we would never stay anywhere else. i also wanted to mention we never heard any construction while we were there. everything was quiet and we both slept wonderfully on the big comfy bed. thank you trip advisor for another great trip suggestion!

"this a great property, excellent location and wonderful staff. everyone was very accommodating and polite. the room i had was on the 23rd floor and was like a suite, with a living area and a bedroom. the living room was spacious, with a plasma tv, a desk and a couch. the beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality. in the closed they placed an umbrella, which came in handy, it rained the whole time i was in chicago. the internet connection is $9.95/24hrs. great place, i will return for sure.

"the omni chicago really delivers on all fronts, from the spaciousness of the rooms to the helpful staff to the prized location on michigan avenue. while this address in chicago requires a high level of quality, the omni delivers. check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in chicago. even the ""standard"" room has a separate living area and work desk. the fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. i shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! all in all, a great property!

"i travelled to illinois from the uk on business, and booked friday and saturday night at the homewood suites so that i could have a weekend in the city. the location was perfect, walking distance to michigan ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff, and literally 100 yards to the l (red line) for getting out to the surrounding areas. the room was great: not exactly 'wow' decor but clean and really well stocked. i was expecting a 'suite' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. it was actually a 3-room mini-apartment, with an open lounge/kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. two flatscreen tvs and a huge bed. breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover(!), and the kitchen meant that i could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed. 
",truth
"my sister and i went to chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because i have a friend who works at homewood suites here in cleveland so we got a discount. the valets were really friendly, you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel. check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level. that also made finding the hotel tricky because i expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that i just had to pull over to the right side of the street. the lady at the front desk was friendly and informative. our room was very clean. the fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants, storing and reheating food. the complimentary breakfast was great! they have real food such as eggs, bacon, french toast, cereal, bagels, juice, milk, and yogurt. the hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to navy pier and passes by michigan avenue. they also have free wifi. overall, i would definately stay here again and i would recommend it to others. 
",truth
"i stayed at this hotel for 1 night. we just wanted to stay in downtown chicago. this hotel is right next to john hancock building. walking distance to many shopping, restaurant, and everything else. from valet people to front desk people, they were all very friendly and helpful. the best thing about this hotel (other than the awesome location) is that all rooms are suites. you can choose 1 king or 2 double which will be inside the room and you get another sofa bed in the living room area. you get 2 tvs also. the roof top pool over looking michigan lake was lovely also.

"everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money, they have excellent customer service, the employees there really cared about their guests, there was always coffee, tea, hot chocolate in the lobby, good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer, the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions, the room did the job, there was a kitchen, 2 flat screen tv's, and a pullout couch included, it was close to the ""el"", but for us we found the buses to be more useful. i would recommend getting a pass, we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $14 which we got at jewel osco, not too far from the hotel, for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families, but us three girls didn't mind, so i would definitely recommend this place, it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels.

"i used to stay at the homewood suites all the time on business but have not stayed there on business since 2005 - since that time my company has been doing business in the suburbs instead of downtown. during december of 2007 and this year 2008 i did stay there a few days with my family and was greeted as if i never left. there is a lady named connie who works the breakfast shift and she greets everyone and always remembers you from years before. a wonderful lady indeed - my wife even commented to me on the way to chicago if that lady would still be there and would still remember and yes she does! its a great place to stay.

(p.s. the weather was in the high 70s). to get back to the hotel, it was fantastic, it has everything you need and its write in the heart of the city. two seperate rooms were very handy as we had our teenage son. full kitchen, (laundry on 7th floor) seveal foodmarkets within walking distance, everything within walking distance. you wont need a car and at $42 for valet parking you wont want one. dont take my word for it , check it out you wont be disappointed. oh and did i mention free breakfast and dinner . job done. its a no brainer book now. p.s. theres also a beach within walking distance

"our third stay at the homewood suites chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two. the staff are consistently friendly, polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door, servicing the rooms, managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk. they genuinely seem happy to be working here and can't do enough for their guests. the rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other (we didn't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy). the hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on michigan ave, or catching a bus or subway. there is a jewel osco and a trader joes each within a couple of blocks, which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc. my husband heartily recommends 'binnies beverage depot' for a huge variety of beer. now all we need is an excuse to return to chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the homewood suites, because we wouldn't stay anywhere else!

"when making my reservation, i made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer memorial day. the staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate. the suites are very spacious, clean, cozy, and comfortable. upon on arriving staff were friendly, willing to exceed expectations, and serve me with enthusiasm. the hot breakfast was delicious each morning. the beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest. i would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other chicago hotels. 
",truth
"the location of this hotel was excellent as it is just beside the subway and the bus stop for the free trolley bus to navy pier is just beside the hotel. the room was very spacious. kind of too big for a solo traveler. the view from the room was excellent and it was a great view to sleep at night. the bathroom was spacious too and the room has a big wardrobe. the kitchen has microwave oven and cooking utensils. some of the cooking utensils were a bit dirty, probably because they had not been used for sometime. however, the microwave oven was very useful as i can heat up food to eat at night. you can easily walk to the magnificent mile by cutting across the shopping mall across the road. do check out pizzeria uno which is near the hotel that serves the delicious deep dish pizza. for cheaper food, do check out the foodcourt at the shopping mall. the hotel also serves breakfast and dinner from mon to thur. i did not find the food that fantastic but it was pretty decent. i will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone going to chicago.

"my family and i stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in july, 08. we had (3) 1 bedroom suites. great location in downtown chicago. within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions. the service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly. the breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded. i recommend going early. the rooms were quiet and clean. i highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying >2-3 days. we would stay here again. parking is expensive, about $28/day. it is valet. the cheapest self parking i could find in the area was $24/days so we did valet parking. the valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly. this is my 3rd experience with homewood suites (3 different cities). i have had a great experience each time.

"just back from a business trip. the homewood is in a great location just off the magnificent mile, includes a great breakfast, heavy hors d'ouevres for dinner with beer and all for a pre-paid rate of $129. without a doubt the best value in chicago for a long, long time.

"perfect location, clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay. its in an area with plenty of stores ( the mile) and restaurants. hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall i would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family, friends or on business. the subway to wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door.

"my first trip back to chicago in about 7 years was perfect! i chose the knickerbocker as i had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to michigan avenue, rush street and downtown chicago. i must say i was very impressed with the guestrooms! i had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a refresh from what i've seen in photo's posted on the reviews. the guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a historical hotel! the beds are wonderful -- i need to get a pillow top mattress at home! i used the internet access with no issue and i loved the larger screen tv's. the shower is fun with the different types of shower heads you can choose. and the bathrooms are fresh with all new granite and tile. i'm anxious to get back to chicago and it won't be 7 years from now! i would highly recommend this hotel -- fantastic guestrooms, location and staff! i've added some digital pictures of my room as they are completely different from the one's i saw on previous reviews with the new renovation. 
",truth
"we absolutely loved the knickerbocker. now, if you expect your hotels to be cookie cutter comfortable, forget this place. if holiday inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs, the knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city. the location is great, the hotel bar is cozy and classy, and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in victorian mansions. for the price, you simply can't do any better than this in downtown chicago. 
",truth
"other reviews complain about the small rooms. for a major city, we found our room quite comfortable with a king bed and really nice furnishings. one feature we liked is the ability to open the window. the knikerbocker is a small boutique hotel right off michigan avenue in the best area of chicago. the staff was friendly and helpful. for the $116 we paid on hotwire, we could not have found a better room in downtown chicago. 
",truth
"we were greeted by staff with excellent customer service skills. our room was such a pleasant surprise, from the flat screen tv, the full size shower with rain showerhead & hand held shower wand, the wall attached toilet with flushing options (on the wall), the comfortable bed, the lovely lighting options, etc.. the size of the room was snug, and very comfortable, as would be, in a historic hotel. it was also quiet, and i know that the hotel was sold out. my sister was in the room next door. we did not hear her tv. we also loved walking less than a block, to the shopping and restaurants on north michigan avenue. 
",truth
"we stayed here as an alternative spot for a friend's wedding. the price was about 50% to 65% of what it costs to stay at similar hotels in the area. first the minuses. 1.) the standard rooms are small. if you want a little more space you might want to upgrade. 2.) since the hotel has been recently rehabbed you can see some of the stuff that the covered or painted. 3.) there really are no views from the hotel. now the plusses. 1.) the shower is awesome. probably one of the best hotel showers i've seen. rain shower with wand, great pressure and the enclosure didn't leak like a lot of these shower stalls do. very nice. 2.) the fixtures and finishes in the rooms were top notch. very modern and clean. 3.) the bed was great. better than some hotels that promote their beds. great nights sleep. overall. this is a great space for a trip where you are not going to be spending much time in the room. if you were in town for a conference or for work where you will need to spread out your stuff it might not work. anyone else should really like the experience. all i care about when i travel is having a nice bed and a good shower to relax in after a long day. if you are the same this is a good spot for you.

"we stayed 2 nights at the knickerbocker and could not have had a better stay. the hotel has recently renovated there rooms. the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful from dave and cora at the martini bar to julie at the front desk who help out with an upgrade for us. the hotel has everything you need for your stay and is close to all the fun that chicago offers. our pick for the city is the knickerbocker. john and judy.

"the knickerbocker hotel is fantastic! it's an old hotel with updated rooms - so you get the old-timey charm and fresh comfort all at once. the hotel has a fabulous location. it's a one minute walk to the cheesecake factory and bloomingdales, and about a 5 minute walk to einstein bagel company (the best bagels and cream cheese ever), macys and saks. this location can't be beat. you're at one end of the magnificent mile, so it makes for easy strolling, as you don't start in the middle and then backtrack. the hotel staff are super helpful and friendly. checking in and out was very smooth, and the concierge (cheryl) was amazing. she booked all our dinner reservations and activities for us, and recommended an incredible restaurant called carmines which was a 5 minute walk. it was the greatest italian restaurant i have ever been to, and i can't recommend it more. the rooms are small but not too small. we had a beautiful big samsung flat screen, cordless phones, a rain shower, ample clean towels, and beautiful marble countertops. the hotel rooms have european charm to them and made me feel like i was at a 5 star hotel in europe. the beds are very comfortable and the duvet is soft like butter. the only complaint i had was that housekeeping woke us up at 8:30 one morning when the knocked on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on. when we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit miffed. the issue was corrected, though, and it didn't happen again during our 4 night stay. the hotel has some unique items on their room service menu - ie - grilled cheese with mini tomato soup for dipping. very cute. their late night menu, however, is lacking. it would have been nice to see some soup on there. that being said, i rarely order from room service when on vacation, so i really don't see that being a big deal. overall i would recommend this hotel without hesitation. i think we paid about 130 a night and i would say it was worth far more than that. we had a wonderful experience and i truly look forward to staying there again....wouldn't stay anywhere else!

"just got back from three nights at the knickerbocker. went up to chicago for some last minute christmas shopping. hotel is in a great location. north end of michigan ave. about half a block away. staff was very nice and professional. everyone we came in contact with was very helpful. granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets. we were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room. good size room, with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed. bathroom was somewhat small. housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day. did not eat at the restaurant nix, but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar. overheard comments saying the food was very good. drink service at the martini bar can be slow. martinis run $9 and up. very good drinks and they don't shy away from the liquor. valet parking was $35 a day with in/out priviliges. overall a great stay. would definately stay at this hotel in the future.

"this hotel was magnificent! not only was it a mini palace, but the staff was polite, helpful, and professional. in an e-mail i received before we left for chicago, the concierge, les, offered to get us tickets, directions, reservations to anything we'd like to see/do. he also got us an upgrade on our room, and when someone rudely butted in line as we were registering, the registry person said they would upgrade our room just for that. and so we were granted a beautiful suite complete with king size bed and jacuzzi. the bed and the linens were so comfortably both of us slept late every morning!

"if you have not tried the millennium knickerbocker for a stay in chicago, do it now! we have stayed (and enjoyed) at the drake, intercontinental and others, but we always now come back to the knickerbocker. why? if ""charlie"" the doorman is on duty and you pull up, he will welcome you. he'll probably ask your name. why? because he wants to call you by your name every time he will see you during your visit. somehow he even lets the other employees know your name and all of a sudden, doorman, receptionist, bellman, waiter are referring to you by name. the employees are what makes this hotel. yes, it has everything to offer like all hotels, but the others don't have the fine people (including the cleaning staff) these folks have. try it, you will like it. we look forward to our next visit already...

"i love this hotel. it is one of the best that i have stayed in. the lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable. the made services was terrific. no matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back. i asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly. that is what i liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly. i was there with my daughter for a girl's weekend from thursday - sunday. everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc. was wonderful. i can't say enough good about this hotel. yes the bathroom was small, but i wasn't moving into the room. i was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway. i will definitely stay there again 
",truth
"we really enjoyed our brief stay at the millennium knickerbocker! from the front desk personnel and bellmen to the housekeeping staff and bartender, everyone we met was helpful and welcoming. our 11th-floor room was clean and beautiful, and the view looking north to the drake hotel and apartments across the street was nice. the in-room coffee service was appreciated, too. there isn't a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletries, but i'd still take a room in a beautiful older hotel with character over a spacious-but-cookie-cutter room any day! 
",truth
"ok, we are back from the knickerbocker and i would give it the best rating. i can't believe the bad reviews. i got a priceline deal, and i still got a fine room, clean, up-to-date furnishings (ok a little traditional for my taste) and smoke free. someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews. i think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth. here it is from my point of view. both rooms on 10th floor. regarding the size of the rooms. we had two rooms. one was a 2 double bed room. it was about 20' x 15'. each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies. the furniture, bathroom tile, shower (no tub), wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years. a chinese inspired cabinet held tv, coffeemaker, ice bucket, and mini-bar. three separate levels (tv, ice/coffee, and minibar) the other room was called ""queen executive"". this one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence, sofabed, two tvs and terry bathrobes. also about the same size but different configerations. one tv faced the bed, other in the three level cabinet, the sofabed. smoke in the lobby. there is a bar to the right of the entrance. it is an open arrangement so that i am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door. no smoke smell in no-smoking rooms. cost of rooms $75 on priceline plus taxes. very good value one block from n. michigan ave. only complaint. concierge said that the free trolley didn't go down michigan ave to field museum/museum complex when in fact it does. was this ignorance? or trying to throw more business to taxi? either case, not good. he said at this time of year free trolley only goes to navy pier during winter....which is clearly incorrect.

"my wife and i had to stay downtown for event that we were attending at the drake hotel. i have stayed at the drake before and while it is nice, it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price. we opted to walk across the street and stay at the millenium instead. i know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and i have to say they have done a great job. this place used to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to chicago on a college roadtrip (i did). but that is not the case any more. this property is directly across from the drake hotel and for 1/2 the price you get their great location with a newer (albeit smaller) room and every ammenity you would expect from a 4* hotel. the rooms are tastefully decorated (asian influence w/flat screen tv) and the bed is very comfortable. the bath is small (no tub), but very clean and the shower is great. you are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when visting chicago, so the room's size is not a big deal. (it works well with a couple, but a family of four may be a bit cramped.) the service was attentive and friendly and the location can't be beat. i would definitely stay here again, but the next time i would leave the car at home ($49/night parking is a bit steep).

"i loved this hotel - fabulous old building but with first class modern amenities. great location, as it's so close to both lakeshore and city. chicago is such a walkable city, so this was a superb base. the staff were just lovely - so very friendly and efficient. the room was wonderful - very, very comfortable and exceptionally clean. great chair. great coffee. lovely bathroom with a huge, absolutely fantastic shower. it was also extremely quiet. that, and the best bed ever, meant i slept so well and since i was there for a week, that was very important to me. yummy martinis at the martini bar. i will most definitley be back!

"i was lucky enough to get a ""4 star"" hotel off of priceline for $70 - i was luckier that i got the knickerbocker! from check in to check out the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. the rooms are small but cozy. after reading the reviews from other guests i was somewhat scared of what i would find - they must have stayed at a different hotel. i am a very frequent traveler and felt that the rooms and the hotel met the ""4 star"" rating. yes, the rooms and bathrooms were small, but what historic hotel in a big city isn't? the decor and quality met my expectations. the lobby and bar were very inviting. overall, i would stay here again and again. 
",truth
"i stayed here for about a week during a conference and the service was excellent. in addition to the excellent service the location was great. with quick access to michigan ave.. the bars and shula's restaurant were excellent. you must have the rib-eye steak...very well done.

"when we were stranded in chicago for two days since our flight home was canceled, our airline put us in touch with hotels.com who found us the room at the sheraton towers. after a long and frustrating day that ended up with us still in chicago, arriving at the sheraton was a joy. the entire staff was wonderful. the bell staff was great helping us (finally) let go of the heavy bags, jonathan at check in was very helpful and had us in a room which he upgraded for us in no time. we enjoyed the location and the facilities of this property during our unexpected stay and would highly recommend this location to others. we can't say enough about the staff. if we are in chicago in the future we will definitely return here! 
",truth
"we stayed at the sheraton by navy pier the first weekend of november and were very pleased with the accommodations and the service. we were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining. the view from both rooms was spectacular (as you can tell from the picture attached). they also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special. the hotel is central to both navy pier and michigan ave. so we walked, trolleyed, and cabbed all around the area. we ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good. the eggs were a little runny, but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station. our six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $14 (instead of the adult $20) the rooms were clean, the concierge & reception staff were both friendly and helpful...we will definitely visit this sheraton again when we're in chicago next time.

"having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website, i arrived tired from ireland, to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night, but did have rooms for the rest of the week. they booked me in to another (not as nice) downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation. on my return to the hotel next day, i was upgraded to the club level. what really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake...unprompted. of course, the hotel itself (particularly on the 32nd floor) is excellent. i will definitely be back.

"we recently celebrated our 20th anniversary in chicago and stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers. having looked at a gizillion places i chose this one because of its location to navy pier. (we were going on a dinner cruise-the odyssey at navy pier) the hotel is a short walk...unless you are wearing heels:) to navy pier. we found out on the way home only a $5 cab ride:) worth $20 to your blisters!! its also only a short walk to michigan ave shopping...for comfortable shoes perhaps?? i chose this hotel because of location, but the views are also terrific. this time we had a lake view of navy pier, but our previous trip we had a river and lake view. both very nice. the hotel is very nice. several restaurants, although we haven't tried them. the burger place downstairs sure smelled good though:) we ended up at bubba gumps at navy pier. good! the rooms were very spacious and clean!! i am kind of a germaphobe! so clean is important for my sanity:) the bottom level has doors that leads right out to the riverwalk, and a cool water fountain. :) i obviously highly recommend this hotel:) i <3 chicago

"the sheraton was a wonderful hotel! when me and my mom flew in we were really tired so we decided to take a quick nap. we didnt want to get up! the beds are absolutely to die for. i wanted to take it home with me. the service was great and this was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest hotel ive ever stayed in. they had a really nice restaurant inside with excellent food.

"we always stay at the sheraton chicago hotel & towers when we take our kids to the city. you can't beat the location which is in walking distance of navy pier and michigan ave. the hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous fox & obel, a high end grocery store with many prepared items available to go and a great cafe that serves a stellar breakfast. the hotel staff are professional and courteous and the rooms are more than adequate with very comfy beds. my kids enjoy the pool with it's windows that overlook the chicago river.

"my husband, teenage son and myself stayed at this hotel last august. we were transferred there by tour operator who had sent us to a terrible hotel on the other side of chicago. when i complained i asked for us to be transferred to the sheraton which they arranged for us. i have stayed at many hotels in my life and this has been the best. the room (although i know it was not the largest) was beautiful and very clean with every amenity you needed. it also had superb views of the river and the lake. the entrance hall to the sheraton is so imressive as is the leisure centre. in fact all areas are fantastic. the best thing about the hotel though was the staff! from the bellboy, to the receptionists, the dining staff to the concierge - each one was courteous and so very helpful. one of the conciergies spent fifteen minutes on the phone trying to locate a specific pair of trainers for my son! above and beyond the call i would say! i cannot reccomend this hotel highly enough. the breakfast buffet cost about 10 dollars each but you could eat as much as you like and take as long as you like which we did!! it lasted us all day. if you have the choice of where to stay i think you will enjoy the sheraton! we did!!

"we stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in august. we waited a while to check in even though there were quite a few desks open, this was a little annoying as the receptionists seemed to work in two's. our room had a great view of navy pier and was a good size. the bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. the location of the hotel is the best, we walked to navy pier and michigan ave. the breakfast buffet was great although a little pricey and the bar very relaxing for a nightcap or two. would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again. 
",truth
"i have been 4 times in chicago, and i have stayed in 4 different hotels: this has been for much the very best option. the lobby, the warm of the receptionist, the room, the hotel is very good. it is walking distance to the magnificent mile and there's no chance for you to get lost from this hotel. if you like to travel with style this could be a very good option.

"i stayed for just one nite at the sheraton hotel and towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other ta posters but i was not let down. i got the room via pl @ $70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot. since i had nothing to lose, i asked to be moved to a ""room with a view"". the front desk attendant( rasheeda) wanted to make sure that the room i had at first was clean and was in order and i assured her that it was. she then moved me up to the 24th floor with ease and it took about 1 minute. i was quite surprised as i have heard that they treat pl and hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers. the new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the navy pier, a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of lake michigan. all this for $70? yep! i skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious! the room was comfy, had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location. i didnt use it since i wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk. the bed and pillows were very comfy, but i awoke at about 330 in the morning sweating from the comfy but very warm and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed. this was a great deal for the price and i would absolutely stay here again.

"i booked this via priceline, and was not sure i'd like it, as some sheratons have fallen off the cliff. this hotel absolutely surpassed my expectations. despite booking with priceline, i was treated like a king. they let me check in early, gave me a beautiful room, and even went so far as to look up my starwood number so i could get some credit for the stay. the staff was unfailingly pleasant, the property immaculate, and the room very comfortable. i highly recommend this hotel.

"great location - right on the chicago river - away from the other skyscraper hotels - our room was good size, very clean and with a nice river view - overall, a great staff - in particular i would like to point out christy morgan - chief experience officer and paula fortney - concierge for their assistance in making this stay a memorable one - (in the interests of full disclosure, we stayed here on our amex - starwood points) 
",truth
"this is a great hotel! the views are fabulous, the service it friendly and the location is superb. we booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the chicago river. the only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped. we booked our room for $89 a night for memorial day weekend. it was a steal! i highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be returning!

"my daughter and i were in chicago for one night after having attended a three-day conference elsewhere in illinois. we were only in chicago on our way home. we didn't know where to stay in chicago, but booked one night at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers based on their ad in the chicago visitors guide. we're glad we did! we enjoyed our stay very much. our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city. that's what we wanted--a great view, and we got it. also, the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop (we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it wasn't bad--saved us a lot of money). the elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available. we found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating. the only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in chicago. we wish we could have stayed there at the sheraton for at least another night. we would definitely stay there again.

"this is one of my favorite sheratons/starwood properties. i have stayed at a lot of hotels (mostly starwood) in chi but all around, this is my favorite based on cost, amenities and downtown location. i really like it beginning with unloading the taxi because i am greeted by nick who has been there for years. he gives the best greeting from la to ny and is always happy! he obviously loves his job. people at the front desk are always nice and efficient. if you like to workout, roberta runs their fitness center. another one who loves their job and serves guests well. great lake / river view while working out. on this particular trip i was caught in a pinch; however, christy the former mgr was able to take care of a frequent guest. i considered it a ""minor miracle"" based on hotel availability. the maids on 29th floor were very friendly and efficient. another great experience.

"i thought the swissotel was a great hotel. the rooms were very spacious and clean, especially for downtown chicago standards. most importantly, the rooms were quiet. i never heard people in the hallways when i was trying to sleep. the only downside was that the beds were not anything special. sure, like all hotels in chicago, this hotel caters to wealthy and/or business clients with ridiculous minibar and parking price. however, if you are aware of that prior to arrival, its not a big deal (ie finding a different place to park the car, bringing our own snacks for the room). it would be nice though if hotels such as the swissotel had a microfridge in the room for guest use. staff was very helpful. bellmen instantly got cabs upon request, and the front desk was efficient and helpful. overall, if i can get a good rate again, i'll stay at the swissotel the next time i am in chicago.

"i am a fan of kimpton hotels, however i have never experienced top service as i did at the hotel allegro. even before my visit, concierge mark kraemer advised us on things to see, and booked tickets in advance to second city. we were welcomed warmly on arrival, and the bellman checked up on us as we came and went from the hotel. all the staff have a personal interest in making your stay a great experience. the hotel is next to city hall, where i had some business. we had a large quiet room, and used room service-the meal came quickly, and included a a bonus fruit cup. enjoyed the pasta night (20 dollars for a three course meal) at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful, the main pasta a bit too salty. and that is the only complaint i can make-from start to finish, if you want attentive service, this is the place to be. thank you, hotel allegro, for a great stay. i can't wait to return. 
",truth
"i stayed at the allegro in july for 4 nights for a business trip. the room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great. i had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny, but ours was perfectly fine, with funky, fun doors. the decor is a lot of fun. we were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise. the front desk staff was very friendly, and before we even made it to the desk, a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival. we were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to navy pier. for people who were upset about no free coffee - there's a dunkin donuts about a block away. i definitely recommend this hotel! 
",truth
"the only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other kimpton hotels. it was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee. the robes were not in the room and it took a long time (hours) but other than that a great place. the concierge was excellent. 
",truth
"my husband and i stayed at the hotel allegro in march, 2006. we had a great time! we were upgraded to a suite, and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with mr. bubbles, animal print robes, and a luxurious king- sized bed! the suite was very nice, and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street. it was very boutiquey, and the lobby was lovely. we enjoyed the complementary wine hour. the staff was attentive, and our stay in this kimpton hotel made our first-time trip to chicago memorable! we would return here! 
",truth
"if you're in chicago and want to stay in the loop, the allegro hotel is perfect for you. it's centrally located, stylish rooms and attentive staff. i stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and was very pleased with everything. the bed was very comfy and had plenty of fluffy pillows, large flat screen tv, radio with ipod docking station and bathroom was hip and clean. everyone that i came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. my last day there, i ordered room service and not only was my meal perfect and delivered on time, the kitchen called to see if everything was alright. i have never had that kind of follow up service. i've stayed at the palomar in dc, another kimpton hotel and received exceptional service there too. i will definitely see if kimpton has a hotel at my next destination. 
",truth
"we brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time. small rooms, but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene. lots of interesting amenities in the room. convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping. really loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone. lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere. watch out: the concierge (like all concierges at big hotels) will direct you to mediocre, large restaurants where they get kickbacks. we have stayed here several times and i always check for rooms here when i travel to chicago. however, the hotel is often full so book early. 
",truth
"i loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown chicago, an older hotel with a great reno (a bit over-the-top design, but still very lovely and charming), clean rooms, and very friendly staff. they're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb mastiff cross with a gift bag (treats and directions to an off-leash area), and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog's names on it. 
",truth
"we have stayed here several times and have always found it to be clean with comfortable beds. we were given a choice of breakfast or free cocktails which we thought was a nice touch. our room was small but adequate. location was great, close to the l trains and also close to the train station as we always ""walk"" from union station.

"i stayed here for 2 nights in may 2008. i have to say the hotel was exceptionally clean and very modern and funky. they had a free wine tasting each evening! the restaurant served very good breakfasts and the staff were lovely and helpful throughout the stay. the hotel is located within walking distance to the metro system and also close to shopping / restaurants and sights! rooms were lovely, althou the bathroom was slightly on the compact side. will be back.

"booked via priceline.com for a weekend getaway and got the room for $75 per night. when we arrived via midway we took the orange line to within a block of the hotel for just $2. hotel easy to find. never felt uncomfortable with the neighborhood/area. saw very few homeless or panhandlers. walked all over the place. great location and hotel is about a $5-$6 cab ride from most major attractions/shopping/restaurants. hotel is almost gawdy with colors/decor, but it's not that different from a cruise ship decor. it was not annoying decor by any means. check in was painless and the service was great! heard no noise whatsoever...the reports of ""thin walls"" are greatly exaggerated. the walls are all concrete and thick...we heard nothing both nights we were there! highly recommend this hotel! rooms are small but not crowded for two people...they are old style hotel rooms..very classic 
",truth
"a very nice hotel with small but adequate rooms. the decor was lovely. my daughter and i spent 5-nights here, saw wicked just down the street and used the public transportation to get all around town. was a bit disappointed with the bar/restaurant which opened and closed it's kitchen at will without regard to posted hours. the room description boasted of safe's large enough to accomodate a laptop, so i brought mine. i was informed after check-in that the safes are not in every room (and not in mine). as a side note, i was surprised that nearly all the shops many restaurants closed at 6pm in that area... even the 7-11. 
",truth
"i was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the hotel allegro. however, our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. the room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another. the bathroom was small but well appointed. overall, it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased. others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway. one other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and i can't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe. the area is also very close to public transportation (we used the trains exclusively) and got around quite well without a car. we would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others. 
",truth
"i've stayed at the allegro a couple of times. like the other kimpton properties, it's a classic old hotel that's been beautifully updated. i found the staff to be cordial, and i really like their corporate culture. they're pet-friendly (although i wasn't travelling with the dog), i got a recycling bin in my room, aveda products in the bath and they don't clean with toxic chemicals. the rooms aren't huge and the bathrooms aren't what you're going to get at a hilton. what the allegro lacks in square footage it more than makes up for in cool. ok, they may be a little pricey, but i'm willing to pay a bit more considering the higher cost of doing business responsibily. 
",truth
"we stayed in a king suite at the hotel allegro over memorial day weekend. we paid $130/night, and it was definitely a bargain. the suite was huge - living room with a couch, two chairs, desk; large bathroom; bedroom; two closets. the room had recently been renovated, and was very clean. comfortable bed, friendly staff, great location (near the train and bus), evening wine reception and morning coffee provided. while the allegro isn't a five-star hotel, it is a great place for the money. (note: a friend stayed in a non-suite room, and reported that it was very small. upgrade if possible).

"the allegro in downtown chicago is a great stay/ part of the kimpton group boutique hotels the allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price/ they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city. i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the 'el' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel/ otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors,comfortable beds and in my case great views. if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days / kimpton does a great job and their properties are ""class acts"" 
",truth
"we booked this hotel for the second leg of our chicago stay..it was great!!!! the lion king package was pricey but reasonable, given the ticket costs and the suite. room was great....classical music greeted us when we entered our room after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. nytimes and chicago tribune at your door every morning. one block from the washington el train station. we never saw the small rooms that every one apparently doesn't like, but the suite rooms were fun and our kids loved it. dunkin doughnuts and corner bakery down the block. city hall, picasso structure....this was a great place. book it and also use the golden touch limo service...reasonable. omar is a super guy.

"this hotel cannot be beat for location, price, & atmosphere. the location is ideal, at the corner of state & kinzie. there are fantastic restaurants & bars all around, including house of blues & harry caray's. we stayed in a ""corner king"" room. the room was amazing. two of the four walls are floor to ceiling windows. even just being on the 5th floor, we had great views of the surrounding area. the decor and amenities are unmatched. the decor is very clean & simple but luxurious. the hotel is easy to miss from street level, but shouldn't be. the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. its a perfect home base if your plans revolve around river north, state street shopping, or clark street nightlife. even if you'll be on the mag mile, this is a short cab ride away. we've officially named this our downtown hotel of choice! 
",truth
"stayed here for two days in the first week in january, when hotel was very quiet. got a big corner room. staff are friendly, decor is modern, and there's a huge choice of pastries and cakes and breads for breakfast, which you take back to your room. the free hors d'oevres with the drinks are great antipasti - olives, breads, cheeses and meats, marinated vegetables. this was a really easy hotel to stay in, fairly central - a couple of blocks away from the 'l', and quiet, despite the building work opposite. if you're in chicago, stay here.

"we attended a bachorette party in chicago in aug 2005. there were 10 girls total. we had 5 rooms ... and i did not hear one complaint from anyone during our entire extended weekend. never been to chi-town before, i booked our hotel based on reviews from ta. and we were not disappointed. the staff is wonderful, the happy hour was just fabulous. the room was nice and clean, with a great double headed shower and aveda products was an extra bonus! then you also get free internet in your room! the hotel was chic and hip without the pretentiousness. we still talk about what a wonderful time we had ... and we all agree that if we ever go back to chicago we will be staying at the amalfi again. trust me the pics don't do it justice!

"this small boutique hotel is tucked away in a perfect location between the loop and the miracle mile. two blocks west of the wrigley building and so convenient to restaurants, etc. the staff, from doormen to desk folks are extra nice and accommodating. the delicious breakfast on each floor is ultra-convenient, the evening happy hour is more than generous, and the morning paper is welcome. bedding is so comfortable. this is our second stay, and certainly not our last. we love chicago, and this hotel is one of the reasons why.

"we arrived for a weekend stay and really enjoyed the hotel. the cocktail hour was so full of people that we could not get in. the second night we went earlier and it was very nice. the staff was very helpful and had a good knowledge of the area. the rooms were modern and very clean. we will stay there again. 
",truth
"just spent three nights at the amalfi hotel, while in chicago on business. booked a king-corner room and loved it. largest room i've ever had in a hotel in chicago, incredibly comfortable, very clean. the breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too. and the location couldn't be beat. walking distance to the the river, the loop, michigan ave shopping and convenient to public transportation. i noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise; yes there is some street noise, and the building across the street is under construction (the noise from that was usually between 730-4, if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side) but really, in downtown chicago it's not going to be silent, if you want silence stay in the suburbs. if you want a great hotel (at a great price) right in the thick of everything, stay at the amalfi.

"this hotel was great - in a great area right downtown and close to everything. the daily happy hour had great food, wine and premium liquors. the free breakfast was even better! actually i believe everything was included breakfast/happy hour/business center/wifi. our room was a king size facing the back of the building. really clean new and comfortable. small touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel - would highly recommend. 
",truth
"this was our second time staying here. we were very much looking forward to our weekend at the amalfi (based on how well the first stay was). it turned out better than our anticipation. the beds are very comfortable. 2 headed showers with a large bathroom. the hotel is also pleasantly quiet and easy to check-in and out. our room was near the exercise room which helped motivate us to get in an hour morning workout. then we were able to grab some complimentary fruit, pastries, juice and coffee on our floor (breakfast is on every floor). no great view from our room, but i don't think there are great views from most any room since it is only 5 floors. we didn't need to drive, take a cab or jump on the l the whole weekend since the hotel is centrally located. we easily walked to bars, blues clubs, restaurants, the hancock tower, the loop and the waterfront all from our hotel. the highlight of the hotel was the complimentary happy hour. free top-shelf drinks and wonderful meats, cheeses, peppers, and breads. this ran from 5:30 to 7:00, and was a great warm-up to a nice dinner. this alone saved us a bundle in money that would of been spent eating and drinking out in the evening. and an extra money-saving tip...park at the self-park lot 2 blocks west of the hotel on kinzie. its $24 per night during the week and only $6 per night on the weekends. i think the hotel charges $30 to $40 per night to park.

"review's a little late, but... my husband & i first stayed at the amalfi in 8/06 totally based on reviews i read on this website. we were totally wowed!! loved the location, the room, the aveda bath products, but most of all loved the evening reception & breakfast on our floor. i returned to chicago with 3 girlfriends in 9/07 and booked us in a suite at the amalfi. it was great - room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased! will stay next time i'm in chicago too!! p.s. they honor a government rate!!!!

"this lovely hotel has only six floors, making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception. the building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it. trump's huge new tower is just down the street. the amalfi looks recently refurbished, very modern, but warm and inviting. bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very, very comfortable beds. bathroom quite small but roomy enough, with aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers. continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor. great to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc (robes & slippers provided) without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast. really enjoyed the managers evening cocktail reception, especially the amalfitinis. a nice way to relax after a hard days' shopping! location is great for all the shops, transport, museums etc. easy walking to everywhere. staff also very friendly and welcoming. would definately stay there again.

"i decided to book at the amalfi after cancelling a reservation for a different hotel after reading their reviews on ta. i was blown away by the reviews for the amalfi on ta and decided to check it out. i was able to secure a great price on the hotel room and i was not disappointed. i asked to be put in a quiet room because i was having an interview the next day. the room was very quiet and in a great location, but my only complaint was that it was right next to the fitness center and i could hear people running on the treadmill during the day. however, it quieted down at night and i could not hear anything. the rooms were enormous for chicago and i was pleased!!! the hotel provided free breakfast which was good, free internet, and free gym access. the hotel is only a few blocks from the magnificient mile and i walked there everyday to do shopping. i have to say that the doorman is truly a gem and is very friendly. i wish that their front desk staff were as friendly as he was. all in all, i plan to stay at the amalfi anytime i visit chicago in the future.

"we stayed here through hotwire and got an amazingly low rate- $60 some odd dollars nightly for a 2 night stay last may. the room they had us in was small and had no view of anything except the wall of the other part of the hotel, but it was very clean, tastefully decorated and cozy. we had a great vacation, walking all over town until we ended up near the planetarium which was where we then turned around and saw the skyline of chicago and were just wow. so anyway, the hotel is great, the service was great, the room was very nice- i would recommend this hotel to anyone though i work at the front desk of a hotel myself and the previous person's comment about how she wasn't able to get adjoining rooms, well, internet sites don't guarantee things like that anyway- you've got to call the hotel direct and verify things like that. there's a note about that on internet sites as well- no room type/location is guaranteed. 5 stars out of 5 for this hotel.

"stayed here for 5 nights while visiting chicago for the first time. the location is great, the hotel has been recently renovated and our room was very spacious with two bathrooms. the lobby is a great place to chill and have a drink. didn't eat in the restaurant but there are a few good ones nearby and we were beside the art institute, cultural centre & macys. staff were friendly. would recommend it as a base to tour the city.

"my wife and i spent several nights here on a getaway excursion. i didn't choose it -- priceline gave it to me for $70. if i'd paid the book rate, $175, i'd have been less pleased. no troubles with checkin. very small room but bed was clean and comfortable. starbucks in the lobby was a godsend. i'd read horror stories about the staff but they seemed friendly enough. for $70, it's a steal. for its online face value, not so much. will definitely return if can get similar price.

"had to bring my new puppy with me on a business trip and stayed at the palmer house. the service was wonderful, staff was very friendly towards dog owners, even stopped to tell me how nice my dog was. easy access to red line from midway. valets were prompt at retrieving car (they recommended calling down in advance we did and the car was there waiting).

"just returned from a week in chicago with the family. this hotel was perfect for us. location is great, kids loved the pool as a place to wind down after a day of museums, touring, ball games, etc. we checked in through hilton honors desk as opposed to the regular check in line. even though our reservations were through priceline at a reduced rate, they gave us a pick of the the rooms. the room had a large closet which helped with the amount of gear we had with us. used valet parking which was hasselfree. we had a great experience and would stay there again.

"my wife and i stayed for 2 nights and loved it. our stay was booked for us by virgin atlantic when we booked our flights from london to chicago. we were not quite sure what to expect but were reassured by the hilton brand name. in the event we found that the airline knew what they were doing when they suggested this hotel. on arrrival we got a warm welcome and the check in was quick and efficient. the interior of the hotel is spectacular and looks like has been refurbished to reflect the decor as it would have been when it was built. the room we were given was a good size with 1 queen bed which was particularly comfortable. the hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby. the first night we ate at the hotel's own gourmet restaurant (the lockwood) which did not disappoint. the breakfasts are also served in this restaurant. we had the buffet both mornings and these were good value for the quality offered. generally we found the service in this hotel good and the staff very helpful. a nice touch was that when we checked out of the hotel to go to our next destination the car we had booked to pick us up was a few minutes late arriving. a member of staff supervising the doormen saw us looking a bit lost and came over to assist us find the car when it did arrive. overall i would thoroughly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays for both quality and value for money.

"my wife and i redeemed some of my hilton reward points to stay a few nights at the palmer house. the hotel is absolutely beautiful. from the moment you walk into the lobby you can tell that this place is nice. as we were diamond members we got upgraded to a suite which was great because we were provided access to their executive lounge (free food & drinks). the service was excellent and the location of the hotel is within walking distance of many sights on the south side of chicago. i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone interested in coming to chicago.

"we stayed at the palmer house hilton in early december, we stay there that weekend every december and we think it is the best location in the city for us. we like state street better than michigan avenue and the palmer house is right there. we stayed in the towers, in a room with two double beds and 2 baths. the room was not huge, but very comfortable. the towers area was recently refurbished and it shows, the lobby is beautiful with plasma screen tvs on the walls, comfortable chairs and tables and a seperate room for the food/drinks. there is a continental breakfast in the morning, appetizers during cocktail hour and cookies are laid out until the room closes. there is a fridge stocked with soft drinks, water and juice that are yours for the taking. we were very pleased with the upgraded towers, everyone should check it out!

"we just got back from a great weekend in chicago and have no complaints about the palmer house. it's very easy to get to from o'hare(the blue line on the el train) and then just a 2 block walk from the train station. the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and go out of their way to help. we booked an air/hotel package deal on expedia. we expected to stay in a room with a full size bed but for only $45 extra per night we upgraded to the excutive level! best decision of the trip. we had a beautiful room with a king bed,down comforter,robes,plush towels etc...it also included a nice continental breakfast each morning,all day snacks and beverages and a great happy hour! we took advantage of this every day. the location was great..lots of shopping along state st. and to get to the magnificent mile was a $5 cab ride or a 20 minute walk! we'll be back to chicago and the palmer house!

"guys trip to chicago, scored this hotel on priceline for $100 a night. had a little confusion over the bed situation at first. they said they only had kings available even after i had called and requested 2 doubles. after a 30 minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with 2 doubles. the room was nice, nothing specacular, a little on the small side but nice. the lobby was beautiful to look at but that's about it. hotel is within walking distance to soldier field, sears tower, espn zone, and lots of bars and restaurants. great location that and the price we got the room for made our trip. would definately try and stay at this hotel again.

"we just returned from a weekend at the palmer house. we normally stay north on the mag mile but wanted to be closer to soldier's stadium and the art insitiute this time. we were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival at half the price that we paid for a regular room at the four seasons two weeks earlier. what a suite!! it was huge. the basic living room, dining room and kitchen/wet bar area was one large room. up to three additional bedrooms can be added by the use of connecting doors. all rooms were spotlessly clean. they even smelled good. lovely soaps, robes, etc. lots of large closets. the bathrooms were older but well maintained. much better than the ones at the four seasons. the furniture was nice but worn in some spots. the beds and linens were excellent. room service was fast. the food and service were great. the pool and workout areas were clean and well maintained. we had one small problem with a burned out lightbulb in one of the lamps. maintaince arrived quickly with a new bulb. they wouldn't allow me to tip them!! check-in was somewhat slow as the hotel has been sold out for several weeks. this is a very large hotel, so they have to move a lot of people and rooms. also, the hotel does not have views as it is configured like an ""e"". all in all, the palmer house is a good value for the money.

"my wife and i decided to spend three days in chicago last summer, and booked via expedia. when we first walked into the lobby we almost fell over at its' beauty. it's like something out of europe. we were able to get a free room upgrade, even though the rooms are still a bit small, but its' an old hotel in an old city. it's there for sleeping and showering. the restaurants, lounges, and shops were all wonderfull. the next time we travel to chicago, i'll be affraid to stay anywhere other than the palmer house hilton

"i booked this hotel for $75 on hotwire with mid-level expectations for one night. totally blown away. arrived on a sunday night. gave car to valet ($51/night). lobby was a social people watching scene with swank music. check-in was smooth and easy. i asked for an upgrade and was told no free upgrades to 3rd party bookings. upgrade to suite was available at a cost. i passed since only 1 night stay. i asked for a nice, quiet room away from noisy housekeeping and ice machine. received room 10-120. room was huge with 2 beds. felt like 400 square feet. newly renovated last year. bell hop told me some rooms are very small so i totally lucked out! service from start to finish was top notch. everyone had a smile on their face. always spoke with great respect and made us feel welcome. ordered room service at 10:45 pm. arrived in 1/2 hour. food was so-so. had pancakes in lockwood for breakfast. very good food and very good service. strong coffee. hotel is right on state street shopping. fyi - rooms on floors 15 and below were renovated last year. rest were done 5 years ago. for the price, it was a great bargain! only complaint is bathroom is small.

"we booked this hotel using points on our credit card. when we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a friendly face. we arrived several hours before check-in. however, they let us check-in early. they also gave us a free room upgrade. the hotel is absolutely stunning! in addition, it is off of state street. there are many things to do - shopping, dinning, theater. it is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the united center or the airport. the hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge. the room was so dark and quiet we slept in.

"i stayed at the palmer house for @ $150/night on a corporate rate. the bed was excellent, the linens/towels were top of the line. i did not find my room shabby, as other reviewers noted. the palmer house is over 130 years old. rooms have older woodwork and classic furniture; i think that lends to the ambience of the place. it is expensive, and i'm not sure i'd stay there if my company weren't picking up the tab. but the hotel itself is still awe-inspiring.

"attended a conference at the palmer house and it truly surpassed my expectations. i had no idea it would be so large, so nice and with so many amenities. i also didn't realize that it is just around the corner from milenium park and the art institute. we were met at the door by the friendliest staff. even with a long line at check-in, the entire process was about 10 minutes. we enjoyed the room with the up-to-date tv, decent size bathroom and comfortable bed. had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant. paid $200/night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown chicago. we have stayed at the sofital which is much more upscale, but we also paid over $300/night there.

"beautiful place with european charm. no complaints, great location, (never like parking in chicago, though). it was $35 a night next door. large beautiful lobby, a touch of class. fantastic location for downtown, navy pier, and the great grant park(millenium park, too)...loved it.

"spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend. the staff was wonderful, room was beautiful and location great. you can take the train directly from midway and walk one block to the hotel. very close to museums and restaurants. i have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to chicago.

"it has been a couple of years since i stayed here, and got it for a night last weekend on hotwire. i paid only $100 and stayed a saturday night. i was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel. the lobby has always been great, but the rooms were a little shabby in the past. not any more, as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years. the location is still amazing, and with the berghoff open again, there is a great restaurant within walking distance.

"stayed here october 31 through november 5 for a cconference. this is beautiful hotel and the location is perfect. the art institute and millenium park is a short 2 block walk from the hotel. my room was small, but beautiful. the bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows. alas, no coffee maker in the room...the staff was helpful and friendly. i'd stay here again!
